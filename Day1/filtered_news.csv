Are GDP growth prospects bright?,2021-02-08,Tribune,"Despite many positives, LNG crisis and fiscal deficit can decelerate economic progress
KARACHI:
 
 The  Asian Development Bank  (ADB) says PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economy can grow 2% in the current fiscal year ending June 2021 after contracting 0.4% last year. 
 The government has also set almost a similar growth target at 2.1%. But we can safely expect a higher growth rate. 
 The most important driver for a higher-than-expected growth is the pace at which global economy is going to recover in 2021. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has forecast 5.2% and Morgan Stanley 6.4% global growth. The IMF makes such projections very cautiously and takes into account the behaviour of all variables. 
 However, the IMF has clarified that its forecast rests not only on economic factors but also on public health ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœwhich is inherently difficult to predictÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â. So, we can expect that global  economic growth  this year could vary vastly from the numbers being projected right now. 
 That said, a majority of reputed analysts agree on the possibility of a sharp recovery in the global economy. This recovery could help accelerate PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economic growth beyond 2% if domestic politics and governance remain impressive. 
 The second driver of higher-than-projected growth is that among top economies of the world, only China posted positive growth, at 2.3%, in 2020 against global recession of 4.4%. Its 2021 growth is being projected at a stunning 9%. 
 Such a high growth in China, our neighbour and long-term development partner through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), can potentially help  Pakistan ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economy grow higher than expected. 
 But here domestic political stability plus a favourable geopolitical environment will be required for harvesting the partnership dividends of a solid Chinese economic growth. The third driver of PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economic growth beyond 2% could be the ongoing drive to revive the construction sector through incentives and policy focus. 
 The government has already extended the tax amnesty scheme for those who invest in the construction sector till December 31 and the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is vigorously pushing banks to offer as many housing loans as possible. It has also launched a web portal for sorting out any and all complaints of those applying for mortgage finance under the Naya Pakistan Housing Scheme. 
 The Federal Board of Revenue, on its part, has made tax regime for the housing sector more investment-friendly. 
 In the case of kick-starting the economy via accelerated construction activity, the real dividend would come in the shape of more-than-projected growth if implementation of the ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœHousing for AllÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â scheme keeps going and does not meet any roadblocks ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ political, administrative or legal. 
 To make that happen, the  government will have to work honestly  and effectively to achieve the much-needed political stability. 
 South Asia growth 
 There is no denying the fact that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government inherited a myriad of structural economic problems and that Covid-19 hit the country just when it was busy fixing some of those problems. 
 But as the government is going to enter its third year, people rightly expect it to deliver on promises of economic growth and development, affordable inflation and low unemployment levels. 
 Even if PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economy grows 2.5% this fiscal year, as the SBP believes it can in the best case scenario, it would be far lower than the average growth of 7.1% projected for the entire South Asian region. 
 And, that would also be too little compared to growth rates of India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. For 2021, the ADB has projected 8%, 6.8% and 4.1% growth rates respectively for these three nations. 
 It is true that the growth in India and Sri Lanka would come in the backdrop of 9% and 5.5% recession respectively they braved in 2020. But then the case of Bangladesh is different. BangladeshÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economy is estimated to have grown 5.2% in 2020. 
 So, how much fast PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economy recovers this year, its pace would pale in comparison to the regional countries and that is where political problems emerge. 
 Political capital 
 Such disturbing forecasts ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ once they materialise ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ would not only erode PTIÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s political capital, but will also reduce the level of exemplary support it enjoys in the powerful establishment. 
 But as long as the government is able to improve the external sector fundamentals and keep inflation under check, it can manage that possible erosion in its political capital. 
 Joblessness, for the time being, is not growing as fast as in the past because of a remarkable rebound in the industrial sector. That rebound (plus year-on-year increase in large-scale manufacturing output in first five months of current fiscal year) has also brightened the scope of higher-than-targeted economic growth. 
 To make the most of this strong recovery, the government has rightly focused on export enhancement. Merchandise exports are now growing moderately and servicesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ exports a bit faster ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ and remittances continue to rise at a swift pace. 
 All this put together will eventually help improve the current account balance, reducing the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s need for short-term foreign funds. In the first half of current fiscal year, Pakistan has reported $1.1 billion current account surplus against a deficit of $2 billion in the same period of last year. 
 Obstacles 
 Despite a number of positives that show the economy is poised to grow at a higher-than-targeted rate this year, two things can potentially decelerate the economic progress. 
 First is the ongoing LNG crisis which has already resulted in an overall gas crisis across the country and started hitting industrial supplies as well and the second is an increase in fiscal deficit. 
 In the first five months of current fiscal year (Jul-Nov 2020), the fiscal deficit stood at 2.8% of gross domestic product (GDP), up from 2.1% in the same period of last year. Gas crisis, if not overcome, will slow down the pace of industrial recovery and hit exports. 
 And fiscal deficit, if not brought under control, will increase the governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s need to borrow more from banks ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ and that will crowd out the private sector, further compounding the challenges being faced by industries and businesses.

Making sense of inflation data,2021-02-08,Dawn,"Three economic things can add to or subtract from the political capital of politicians in power. These are: economic growth, employment levels and inflation.When a government aims to achieve a certain level of economic growth, it normally adds to inflationary pressures in the economy. But on the other hand, it can create more jobs as well. If the economy starts growing without creating enough jobs but pushing up inflation in the process, this jobless growth starts giving headaches to policymakers. That was what we saw in 2018-19, the first year of the PTIÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s maiden government. And when economic growth and employment levels decline, as they did in 2019-20, policymakers are further perturbed and people in power watch in helplessness the depletion of political capital. In 2020-21, the government is trying hard to achieve 2.1 per cent economic growth after the last yearÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s 0.4pc contraction. But this modest economic recovery, even if it is achieved, is not expecteTI policymakers know this and are eager to see inflation under control to minimise the public outcry amidst a slow and, to a large extent, still-jobless economic recovery.    That was perhaps why Prime Minister Imran Khan and Planning and Development Minister Asad Umar took so much pride in the recent fall in consumer and core inflation and shared this good news with the nation with a political pinch Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ that is, inflation numbers had fallen below the levels they inherited.

As recently as December 2020, food inflation in urban and rural areas stood at 12.6pc and 13.4pc, respectively. More disturbingly, non-food, non-energy core inflation that fell to 5.4pc in January in urban areas Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ and made top government officials jubilant Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ was way higher at 7.8pc in rural areas, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS). The PBS calculates food inflation through changes in food items included in a broad list of consumer items whose price-changes are monitored for calculating the consumer price index or CPI. In other words, 7.3pc and 7.2pc food inflation for urban and rural areas represent general food inflation.The PBS calculates inflation through another index, which is known as the sensitive price index or SPI. It gives an idea of how prices of essential items of daily use, mostly food items, behave. Measured through this index, yearly inflation in January stood at 7.7pc. The PBon number obtained through the SPI. But since the SPI basket itself comprises a larger number of food items Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ 32 out of total 51 Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ and since 28 out of those 32 items depicted a rising trend in January 2020 vs January 2019, it is safe to assume that 7.7pc SPI inflation is primarily the outcome of higher food prices.Food inflation stood far higher at 7.3pc in urban areas and at 7.2pc in rural areas in January People generally donÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t know exactly which food items are in the SPI basket of essential items.

NFC Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ a,2021-02-08,Dawn,"The federal government has transferred Rs1.28 trillion to the provinces as their share under the 7th National Finance Commission (NFC) Award Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ from the divisible tax pool and as straight transfers Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ during the first half of the present financial year.The amount transferred is 45.4 per cent of the total provincial share of Rs2.82tr budgeted for the entire year but 3.5pc less than received by the provinces during the same period last fiscal year, according to the federal fiscal operations summary for the first six months to December 2020 published by the finance ministry last week.Last year, the federal government had transferred Rs1.33tr to the provinces during the same period, which is equal to 40.9pc of the total annual provincial share projection of Rs3.25tr for 2019-20. Thus, the provincial transfers are actually down by Rs46.7 billion in absolute terms this year when compared with the last fiscal year in spite of the improvement in the ratio of the amound actually cumulatively received more than a quarter or Rs853bn less than their projected share from the federal transfers last year, which was why the provincial fiscal balance ended up to be in a deficit of Rs81bn against IslamabadÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s projections of a surplus of Rs423bn to keep down the consolidated budget deficit at the close of the year.Provincial transfers are actually down by Rs46.7bn in absolute terms this year when compared with the last fiscal year despite improvement in the ratio of the amount projected for the entire yearThe federal government has projected a provincial surplus of Rs242bn for the present year. But the slowing growth in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collection means it would miss the tax target of Rs4.9tr by a good margin, resulting in lesser than the projected transfers to the provinces. With the provincial expenditure on health increasing because of the Covid-19 pandemic, they may again end up throwing up a bigger than last year deficit when the year ing to the NFC Award, the provinces get 57.5pc of the federal divisible pool. The award, agreed for five years in 2010, expired in 2015. But it has been extended every year since no progress has so far been made on a new award.The situation suits the provinces as the federal government is asking them to forego at least 7pc of the net divisible tax pool revenues for financing security of the multi-billion-dollar China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative, development of the merged districts of erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan, as well as sharing foreign loan repayments, subsidies and losses of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). None of the provinces is prepared to accept a reduction in the provincial share, which is constitutionally protected under the landmark 18th amendment to the Constitution.Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has however been lobbying with the other federating units for giving up a part of their share to support the development of its merged tribal districts. The north-western province is already drawing 1pc from the net pool as compensation for the damage done to its economy by years of war on terror on top of its share under the award.The provincial share is distributed among the federating units on the basis of multiple criteria with population having 82pc weight, poverty and backwardness 10.3pc, inverse population density or area 2.7pc and revenue collection and generation 5pc.The critics of the 7th award, including the International Monetary Fund, have argued that the increased share of the provinces under the NFC arrangements has led the Centre to accumulate massive debt Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ foreign and domestic both Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ because it is left with little or nothing after making loan repayments and paying for the defence of the country. It says the award transferred 10pc of additional tax sources to the provinces.But the provinces insist that their share had grown by less than 1pc of GDP after nough to finance the functions devolved to them after the passage of the 18th amendment. Besides, the federating units contend, the Centre was facing financial constraints mainly because of the poor FBR performance, which was assumed by the authors of the award to raise the tax revenues to 15pc of GDP by 2014-15 from less than 9pc in 2009-10.The reduction in the provincial share during the first half of the fiscal year means a cut in the federal transfers to all the four federating units. Punjab, for example, has received Rs621.7bn or Rs12.7bn less than last year. Likewise, BalochistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s share is slashed by Rs15.6bn billion to Rs133.3bn, SindhÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s by Rs7.8bn to Rs319.9bn and Khyber PakhtunkhwaÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s Rs9.6bn to Rs205.1bn.Surprisingly, however, both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan have stepped up their development spending in spite of reduced federal transfers. Balochistan has increased its development expenditure by almost a quarter to amped up its development expenditure by 37.6pc to Rs50.1bn from Rs36.4bn. Punjab and Sindh on the other hand have slowed down their development spending by around 7pc to Rs108.6bn and by almost 5pc to Rs48.9bn.The slower spending by the provinces has helped them throw up a cash surplus of Rs255.1bn Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ Punjab Rs146.4bn, Sindh Rs44bn, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rs19.7bn and Balochistan Rs45bn Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ in the first six months of the year. This has helped the federal government keep down its consolidated fiscal deficit to 2.5pc and primary surplus of 0.7pc of GDP compared with 2.3pc and 0.6pc in the same period last financial year. Published in Dawn, The","NFC a the federal government has transferred rs 1.28 trillion to the provinces as their share under the 7th national finance commission (NFC) award from the divisible tax pool and as straight transfers during the first half of the present financial year.the amount transferred is 45.4 per cent of the total provincial share of rs 2.82tr budgeted for the entire year but 3.5pc less than received by the provinces during the same period last fiscal year, according to the federal fiscal operations summary for the first six months to december 2020 published by the finance ministry last week.last year, the federal government had transferred rs 1.33tr to the provinces during the same period, which is equal to 40.9pc of the total annual provincial share projection of rs 3.25tr for 2019-20. thus, the provincial transfers are actually down by rs 46.7 billion in absolute terms this year when compared with the last fiscal year in spite of the improvement in the ratio of the amound actually cumulatively received more than a quarter or rs 853bn less than their projected share from the federal transfers last year, which was why the provincial fiscal balance ended up to be in a deficit of rs 81bn against islamabads projections of a surplus of rs 423bn to keep down the consolidated budget deficit at the close of the year.provincial transfers are actually down by rs 46.7bn in absolute terms this year when compared with the last fiscal year despite improvement in the ratio of the amount projected for the entire yearthe federal government has projected a provincial surplus of rs 242bn for the present year. but the slowing growth in the federal board of revenue (FBR) collection means it would miss the tax target of rs 4.9tr by a good margin, resulting in lesser than the projected transfers to the provinces. with the provincial expenditure on health increasing because of the Covid-19 pandemic, they may again end up throwing up a bigger than last year deficit when the year ing to the NFC award, the provinces get 57.5pc of the federal divisible pool. the award, agreed for five years in 2010, expired in 2015. but it has been extended every year since no progress has so far been made on a new award.the situation suits the provinces as the federal government is asking them to forego at least 7pc of the net divisible tax pool revenues for financing security of the multi-billion-dollar china pakistan economic corridor (CPEC) initiative, development of the merged districts of erstwhile federally administered tribal areas (Fata) with khyber pakhtunkhwa, azad kashmir and gilgit baltistan, as well as sharing foreign loan repayments, subsidies and losses of state-owned enterprises (SOEs). none of the provinces is prepared to accept a

pakistan stand on threats from afghanistan FO WASHINGTON pakistan pointed out on sunday that a united nations monitoring report highlighting the presence of various terrorist groups in afghanistan had vindicated islamabads longstanding position that such outfits posed a direct threat not only to pakistan but to the entire region.the 27th report of the UN analytical and monitoring team shows that the Tehreek-i-Taliban pakistan (TTP), which is now based in afghanistan, has carried out more than 100 cross-border attacks during the last three months.the report to the UN security council acknowledges pakistans efforts to uproot terrorist groups involved in subversive activities in the Pak-Afghan region.two official US reports sent to congress last week also underline the presence of TTP and other Pakistan-specific groups in afghanistan and acknowledge that continued support from islamabad allowed US and afghan forces to weaken the ISKP, the regional tan-specific groups in war-ravaged country on sunday, pakistan foreign office spokesman zahid hafeez chaudhri said the reports vindicate our longstanding position on threats posed to pakistan and the region by groups like TTP, jamaatul ahrar (JuA), hizbul ahrar (HuA) and their affiliates, based in Afghanistan.Pakistan has often drawn attention of the international community to the support provided to the TTP and its affiliates by the hostile intelligence agencies.mr chaudhri said that such support led to the merger of JuA, HuA and other splinter groups of LeJ (Lashkar-e-Jhangvi) with the TTP in afghanistan last year. pakistan has also kept the international community informed of the cross-border attacks carried out by the TTP on pakistani security forces deployed on the border.pakistan acknowledges monitoring teams efforts in exposing the hostile agencies sponsored collusion oul to launch a dedicated effort to neutralise this threat emanating from Afghanistan.Pakistan stands firm in its resolve to partner with international community against the menace of terrorism, he said.the UN report, dated feb 3, notes that pakistan has not only arrested individuals engaging in terrorism financing but also has seized the assets of those individuals and entities who have been designated as terrorist by related US and UN agencies.the report underlines TTP activities in afghanistan and expresses concern over the reunification of (TTPs) splinter groups inside afghanistan. five entities pledged allegiance to TTP in july and august (2020), including the shehryar mehsud group, jamaar interest in south asia today, among the several dozen said to be operating in the theater Tehreek-i-Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba. both have demonstrated the capacity to act as major threats to the region.the report warns that both groups can disturb regional peace and can cause a war between the areas two nuclear states, india and Pakistan.Afghanistan remains symbolically and geographically an attractive space for jihadi groups that aspire to attack the united states, its allies, its interests, and the international order it has done so much to create, the report warns.the bipartisan US report also notes that the membership of the ISKP in afghanistan largely consisted of dissident afghan taliban commanders, former members of the TTP and adherents of central asian extremist groups who had formerly been allied with al-Qaeda.ISKP has attracted thousands of adherents, surged, apakistani security forces, the report adds.another report by the pentagons inspector general for afghanistan, known by its acronym SIGAR, cites afghan officials judgements that other terrorist groups including Tehreek-i-Taliban pakistan, Jaish-i-Mohammed, and Lashkar-e-Taiba are operating in eastern Afghanistan.The UN report goes a step ahead and cautions that the reunification of TTP splinter groups has enhanced the threat of terrorism not only to pakistan but to the entire region since it has increased the strength of TTP and resulted in a sharp increase in attacks.TTP was responsible for more than 100 cross-border attacks between july and october 2020, the report states and estimates the TTPs, pakistans envoy to the UN munir akram had said at a press conference after handing over the dossier to the UN secretary-general. we now have gathered irrefutable evidence that india is engaged

He also warned of strong reaction if there was any meddling in the polling exercise.He said that the PPP was ready to contest the elections for the upper house of parliament but alleged that the prime minister was attempting to make them controversial, ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœlike the 2018 general electionsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â by issuing an ordinance for the open ballot.Read More: No one can stop govt from promulgating ordinances, says CJPÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWe are ready to contest the Senate elections against the government even through open ballot, and angry members of the ruling party will vote against them despite the open ballot,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â the PPP chairman told reporters.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœEvery citizen has the constitutional right to secret ballot so that the voter can exercise the right to vote with complete privacy and without any pressure.

However, the majority of assembly members vote on the basis of their conscience.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœIf the PTI government wants electoral reforms it had ample time during the last three years to consult other parties for constitutional amendments.

Why a national image matters,2021-02-08,Dawn,"PRIME MINISTER Imran Khan made a number of assertions recently at the launch of a documentary film about the irrelevance of promoting a Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½soft imageÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ of the country. These statements warrant comment as the prime minister isnÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t alone in holding these views. Other people also subscribe to this opinion.The prime minister said that the people of Pakistan should not be concerned about creating a Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½soft imageÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ of the country only to please outsiders, specifically the West. He asked a rhetorical question: what does a Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½soft imageÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ really mean?

Only an independent and confident nation commands the respect of otherseement with his assertion that national confidence comes from Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½standing on one ownÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s feetÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ and not relying on aid or borrowing from outside. However, the projection of a Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½soft imageÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ that he regards as futile seems to be based on a misunderstanding and is at odds with what he has said at other times. He has often stated how tourism and PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s scenic beauty can help to promote the countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s image and attract more visitors. Also, at the same launch event he lamented how PTV dramas no longer attract overseas audiences as they once did, which again contradicts the view that the countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s image is of little significance.Soft power efforts are imperative for Pakistan to correct misperceptions and project its many positive attributes.The expression Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½soft imageÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½rs goals in the world. Put simply, a positive image of a country reflects and generates soft power.The image of a country obviously derives from its various attributes Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ society, culture, values, economy and politics. Every country has strengths and weaknesses. Emphasising the positive aspects of a country is not about pleasing others or being defensive. In fact, not doing so allows rivals or adversaries to define you and seize the narrative, to the countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s detriment.Turning to the concept of soft power, its greater importance today is a consequence of our changing times. In a world fundamentally transformed by technological and scientific advances as well as the information revolution the nature of power has also been changing. Widely accepted is the fact that military and economic power are not the only determinants of a countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s international standing and clout. Nor are they regarded adequate any more to guarantee success in secsitive image count and play a pivotal role in earning respect and enhancing its diplomatic weight in international affairs.Harvard scholar Joseph Nye, who introduced the notion of soft power, defined it as the ability to shape the preferences of others and achieve outcomes through Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½attractionÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ rather than coercion or economic incentives. He counterposed the soft power of Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½persuasion and cooptionÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½, to the Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½power of coercionÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ represented by the hard power of military and economic strength. And he saw culture, political values and foreign policy as the main sources of soft power.Other scholarly studies point out that a range of diverse attributes can comprise soft power resources. They include a countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s governance and human rights record, its educational, scientific and technological prowess, culture and heritage, media and communiitary and economic strength Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ and Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½stand on their own feetÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ use soft power in their strategies, and spend a great deal of resources on this, not because they lack confidence, but as this helps to magnify their influence and supplement their Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½hard powerÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½. Western countries have long been practising this while China is now investing heavily in soft power projection and making vigorous efforts to win hearts and minds globally. Building a positive image as part of a soft power strategy is even more important for developing and smaller countries in order to raise their standing and enhance their outreach in a crowded international environment. In an increasingly multipolar and hyperconnected world, power is much more dispersed between and within states. This drives the need to influence a diverse array of actors and many more nations in pursuit of foreign pol policy to support a countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s objectives. Similarly, international opinion matters as it creates perceptions about a country that can help or hinder its ability to achieve its foreign policy goals. Thus, soft power efforts are crucial to positively shape perceptions abroad and ensure that a countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s narrative is heard and accepted.Endeavours to build a good image and be Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½likedÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ in the world enables countries Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ powerful and not so powerful Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ to more effectively promote economic (trade and investment) and diplomatic goals (eliciting cooperation to advance core interests).

will creating such an image mean the world will consider us as very good? this, he argued, only reflects an inferiority complex and the mark of people who lack self-confidence. only an independent and confident nation commands the respect of otherseement with his assertion that national confidence comes from standing on one owns feet and not relying on aid or borrowing from outside. however, the projection of a soft image that he regards as futile seems to be based on a misunderstanding and is at odds with what he has said at other times. he has often stated how tourism and pakistans scenic beauty can help to promote the countrys image and attract more visitors. also, at the same launch event he lamented how PTV dramas no longer attract overseas audiences as they once did, which again contradicts the view that the countrys image is of little significance.soft power efforts are imperative for pakistan to correct misperceptions and project its many positive attributes.the expression soft imagers goals in the world. put simply, a positive image of a country reflects and generates soft power.the image of a country obviously derives from its various attributes society, culture, values, economy and politics. every country has strengths and weaknesses. emphasising the positive aspects of a country is not about pleasing others or being defensive. in fact, not doing so allows rivals or adversaries to define you and seize the narrative, to the countrys detriment.turning to the concept of soft power, its greater importance today is a consequence of our changing times. in a world fundamentally transformed by technological and scientific advances as well as the information revolution the nature of power has also been changing. widely accepted is the fact that military and economic power are not the only determinants of a countrys international standing and clout. nor are they regarded adequate any more to guarantee success in secsitive image count and play a pivotal role in earning respect and enhancing its diplomatic weight in international affairs.harvard scholar joseph nye, who introduced the notion of soft power, defined it as the ability to shape the preferences of others and achieve outcomes through attraction rather than coercion or economic incentives. he counterposed the soft power of persuasion and cooption, to the power of coercion represented by the hard power of military and economic strength. and he saw culture, political values and foreign policy as the main sources of soft power.other scholarly studies point out that a range of diverse attributes can comprise soft power resources. they include a countrys governance and human rights record, its educational, scientific and technological prowess, culture and heritage, media and communiitary and economic strength and stand on their own feet use soft power in their strategies, and spend a great deal of resources on this, not because they lack confidence, but as this helps to magnify their influence and supplement their hard power. western countries have long been practising this while china is now investing heavily in soft power projection and making vigorous efforts to win hearts and minds globally. building a positive image as part of a soft power strategy is even more important for developing and smaller countries in order to raise their standing and enhance their outreach in a crowded international environment. in an increasingly multipolar and hyperconnected world, power is much more dispersed between and within states. this drives the need to influence a diverse array of actors and many more nations in pursuit of foreign pol policy to support a countrys objectives. similarly, international opinion matters as it creates perceptions about a country that can help or hinder its ability to achieve its foreign policy goals. thus, soft power efforts are crucial to positively shape perceptions abroad and ensure that a countrys narrative is heard and accepted.endeavours to build a good image and be liked in the world enables countries powerful and not so powerful to more effectively promote economic (trade and investment) and diplomatic goals (eliciting cooperation to advance core interests). national branding represents a key part of these efforts and seeks to convert soft power resources into an identifiable brand to attract others. again, it is a way to engage internans and partly because of on-ground realities, it is even more imperative to undertake soft power efforts to correct misperceptions, and more importantly, to project its many positive socioeconomic attributes and rich heritage of arts, civilisation and culture. this requires, for a start, official recognition that the endeavour is vital for the pursuit of its national goals and foreign policy interests. it needs, above all, imagination to craft such a strategy and incorporate it into its otherwise staid diplomacy. the writer is a former ambassador to the US, UK and UN.Publi"
Time to extend hand of peace,2021-02-08,Tribune,"Best way to achieve long-term peace will be through trade, starting with this region
KARACHI:
 
 It is ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœtime to extend hand of peace in all directions ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â¦ we stand firmly committed to the ideals of mutual respect and peaceful coexistenceÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â, said Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa, Chief of the Army Staff, while addressing the PAF graduation ceremony last week. 
 It is an insightful statement in tune with the recent global developments. With the successful launch of anti-Covid vaccines and the election of Joe Biden as president of the United States, optimism is replacing despondency the world over. 
 Most countries are now looking towards a quick V-shaped recovery and an era of cooperation to meet the global challenges rather than quibbling with each other. Even countries involved in severe conflicts for the last several decades, such as in the Middle East, are now looking towards peace. 
 In Africa, a new continent-wide free  trade agreement  became operational on January 1, 2021. It is not only expected to promote trade but also peace in the region. 
 Due to our involvement in Afghan war from the early 1980s, we have lost thousands of precious lives and seriously damaged our economy. 
 It was only two decades ago that we had the highest  GDP per capita in the region,  including India and Bangladesh. Due to wrong geopolitical policies, we are now at the bottom. This gap is further widening. 
 According to International Monetary Fund (IMF) projections for 2020-21, emerging economies expect to grow at 6.3%, while PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economy will grow at a mere 1.5%. 
 With its population rising rapidly and growth at a standstill, Pakistan needs to change its focus from hostilities to peace. To achieve long-term peace, we need to re-engage with the rest of the world. The best way for this would be through trade, starting with our region. 
 Over the years,  Pakistan ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s trade with its neighbours has been sliding. The only exception is trade with China, with which we have always enjoyed peaceful relations. 
 Pakistan shares a 2,200km-long border with Afghanistan, but bilateral trade has been shrinking due to political issues. The exchange between the two countries was around $3 billion in 2011, but now it has fallen to $1.3 billion. 
 At the urging of its close friends such as China, Pakistan is making some amends. It has already opened three additional border-crossing points. Both countries are now renegotiating their bilateral transit and trade agreement. 
 Since Afghanistan is a landlocked country, it is for Pakistan to ease restrictions. Pakistan has continued to block AfghanistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s imports from India through Wagah, but it does not serve any economic purpose for anyone. Opening this route will be a major signal to show that Pakistan is serious about achieving peace in the region. 
 Similarly, PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s trade with Iran, the second-largest economy in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, has been falling. Our exports to Iran are just $23 million against IranÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s global imports of $41 billion (2018). 
 This is even though the two countries share a 960km-long border and have a preferential trade agreement. 
 The most significant gains can come from normalising trade relations with our eastern neighbour India, with which we share a common border of 3,300 km. 
 According to the World Bank, the potential of trade between India and Pakistan is $37 billion against actual trade of $2.4 billion (2018), even when business was relatively more open. 
 Previous to the closure of borders, PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s imports from India mostly consisted of cheaper raw material for our industry. For example, we imported over one-third of our cotton from India, but now we have to import from far-off countries like the US and Vietnam. 
 Other industries such as pharmaceuticals are also suffering due to a lack of raw material. Poor date farmers of Sindh, who were so much dependent on exports to India, are now struggling. We can imagine the employment opportunities, industrial growth and poverty reduction that the resumption of trade could bring for our poverty-stricken masses. It will not be easy, but where there is a will, there is a way. 
 After all, both countries reopened their airspace after keeping it closed for six months. They also have to realise that they are not the only ones with territorial or other disputes. Recently, China and India had major border flare-ups, but that did not impact their flourishing bilateral trade. 
 There is indeed no better time than this to extend a hand of peace in all directions. It is in our interest.

Pakistan Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ a tech,2021-02-08,Dawn,"Every other day, there is a statement from someone in the government on PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s potential in the tech sector and how that can be harnessed. One of the favourite talking points within that ambit is tapping into the huge network of freelancers in the country and earning some good foreign exchange. While a singular focus on promoting the gig economy instead of taking concrete steps to boost investment itself deserves some critique, letÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s leave that debate for another time. For now, letÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s turn our focus to what could be a proxy for the tech sectorÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s growth: computers. As a developing nation, Pakistan is an importer of data processing machines. So we can look at whether there has been a major increase in their demand, especially postÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Covid-19, which has been hailed as a game-changer for the digital economy. Using International Trade CentreÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s trade map for prs than 10kg, consisting of at least a central processing unit, a keyboard and a display (excluding peripheral units). Computer vendors say there has been a shift towards older generation machines in recent monthsUnder this category, Pakistan spent $181.6 million on 1.52m units in 2019-20 at an average price of $119.36.While the number of imported units jumped by 462,601 over 2018-19, there was a marked decline in both the total bill and the average price, which fell from $226m and $213, respectively. In percentage terms, this reflects plunges of 19.6 per cent and 43.96pc, respectively. That suggests a move towards cheaper and lower quality machines, which could possibly be a cause of concern. Even in the units imported, the increase doesnÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t really appear to have been triggered by Covid-19 as Pakistan was buying in higher quantities before March 2020.Even though the market people have mentioned a jump in demand for laptops postÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Covid-19 Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½rasons Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ it doesnÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t seem to have impacted the overall imports. The country bought 106,658 units in April-June 2020, the second lowest quarterly figure since the beginning of 2018. In comparison, imports in the preceding two quarters were 132,194 and 155,915 units. What seems more likely is that instead of the countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s total appetite for computers increasing, there has been a move towards older ones. That could explain the downward trajectory of the average price of a data-processing machine, which stood at $131 in June 2020 as opposed to $211 in January of 2018.Computer vendors also paint a similar picture: that there has been a shift towards older generation machines. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½The demand for up to third-generation laptops has more or less doubled, likely because of online classes. On the other hand, that for newer models has slowed down as the price has significantly gone up,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ says Asif Bound Rs16,000 in January. By September, they were being quoted at roughly Rs26,000. The price increase for newer laptops has been as much as Rs20,000-25,000,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ he says. ItÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s a somewhat similar story for personal computers as well, with Mr Badar saying that the price of a used third-generation i5 with 4GB RAM and 250GB hard drive has jumped to around Rs14,000, from about Rs9,000 previously.  Another vendor dealing in new machines says the rates for latest models have gone up by as much as Rs25,000 while one seller based out of KarachiÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s Technocity Mall tells Dawn that the prices of second-generation laptops have risen by roughly Rs5,000-6,000 and those of third-generation laptops by Rs6,000-7,000. To further confirm this thesis, we also looked at the laptop price data from Pakistanistores.com, an e-commerce comparison website. Based on that, there definitely is an upward movement. For instance, Dell Latitude E6430 i5-3320, a particulaRs23,000-27,000 depending on the seller, is now available at Rs35,000 or above. For context, it was released in the second half of 2012.Like with pretty much every other product, the steep rupee depreciation over the past two years has been a key factor in pushing up the prices. As the dollar became more expensive, the rates for computers and laptops moved accordingly, which pushed people towards earlier generation models. That in turn raised demand and, resultantly, prices of older machines, a trend only worsened by Covid-19. Unfortunately, instead of moving ahead with times and adopting newer technologies, we are yet again going in the wrong direction. ItÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s a lot like what happened in the auto sector where obsolete models came to rule the market, though it was the local assemblersÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ oligopoly there. But with virtually no local production of laptops and computers, itÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s unimaginable to think the situation will change anytime soon.

Published in Dawn, The","pakistan a tech every other day, there is a statement from someone in the government on pakistans potential in the tech sector and how that can be harnessed. one of the favourite talking points within that ambit is tapping into the huge network of freelancers in the country and earning some good foreign exchange. while a singular focus on promoting the gig economy instead of taking concrete steps to boost investment itself deserves some critique, lets leave that debate for another time. for now, lets turn our focus to what could be a proxy for the tech sectors growth computers. as a developing nation, pakistan is an importer of data processing machines. so we can look at whether there has been a major increase in their demand, especially postCovid-19, which has been hailed as a game-changer for the digital economy. using international trade centres trade map for prs than 10kg, consisting of at least a central processing unit, a keyboard and a display (excluding peripheral units). computer vendors say there has been a shift towards older generation machines in recent monthsunder this category, pakistan spent $181.6 million on 1.52m units in 2019-20 at an average price of $119.36.while the number of imported units jumped by 462,601 over 2018-19, there was a marked decline in both the total bill and the average price, which fell from $226m and $213, respectively. in percentage terms, this reflects plunges of 19.6 per cent and 43.96pc, respectively. that suggests a move towards cheaper and lower quality machines, which could possibly be a cause of concern. even in the units imported, the increase doesnt really appear to have been triggered by Covid-19 as pakistan was buying in higher quantities before march 2020.even though the market people have mentioned a jump in demand for laptops postCovid-19 rasons it doesnt seem to have impacted the overall imports. the country bought 106,658 units in April-June 2020, the second lowest quarterly figure since the beginning of 2018. in comparison, imports in the preceding two quarters were 132,194 and 155,915 units. what seems more likely is that instead of the countrys total appetite for computers increasing, there has been a move towards older ones. that could explain the downward trajectory of the average price of a data-processing machine, which stood at $131 in june 2020 as opposed to $211 in january of 2018.computer vendors also paint a similar picture that there has been a shift towards older generation machines. the demand for up to third-generation laptops has more or less doubled, likely because of online classes. on the other hand, that for newer models has slowed down as the price has significantly gone up, says asif bound rs 16,000 in january. by september, they were being quoted at roughly rs 26,000. the price increase for newer laptops has been as much as rs 20,000-25,000, he says. its a somewhat similar story for personal computers as well, with mr badar saying that the price of a used third-generation i5 with 4GB RAM and 250GB hard drive has jumped to around rs 14,000, from about rs 9,000 previously. another vendor dealing in new machines says the rates for latest models have gone up by as much as rs 25,000 while one seller based out of karachis technocity mall tells dawn that the prices of second-generation laptops have risen by roughly rs 5,000-6,000 and those of third-generation laptops by rs 6,000-7,000. to further confirm this thesis, we also looked at the laptop price data from pakistanistores.com, an e-commerce comparison website. based on that, there definitely is an upward movement. for instance, dell latitude E6430 i5-3320, a particulars 23,000-27,000 depending on the seller, is now available at rs 35,000 or above. for context, it was released in the second half of 2012.like with pretty much every other product, the steep rupee depreciation over the past two years has been a key factor in pushing up the prices. as the dollar became more expensive, the rates for computers and laptops moved accordingly, which pushed people towards earlier generation models. that in turn raised demand and, resultantly, prices of older machines, a trend only worsened by Covid-19. unfortunately, instead of moving ahead with times and adopting newer technologies, we are yet again going in the wrong direction. its a lot like what happened in the auto sector where obsolete models came to rule the market, though it was the local assemblers oligopoly there. but with virtually no local production of laptops and computers, its unimaginable to think the situation will change anytime soon. the issue of mobile phones incentivise and encourage foreign, especially chinese, players to set up their shop and start manufacturing in the country. for us to move higher in the techs value chain and produce, say, experts on new software, itd be a good idea for people to have access to at least somewhat recent machines.

Neglect of agriculture sector to stall recovery,2021-02-08,Tribune,"Forex reserves will come under pressure due to imports; exporters will face headwinds
LAHORE:
 
 There is optimism that the economy is in the phase of recovery and the situation would further improve in coming months. 
 In order to exhibit this positivity, the government is relying on trade statistics. The usual mantra is that imports were under control and exports kept on increasing in the last four months which happened after eight years. 
 In addition, textile exporters are brimming with orders and even labour shortage has been witnessed in performing certain tasks. The economy has successfully surpassed the worse phase and the trade situation will bring precious foreign exchange which, in turn, will strengthen the rupee. 
 Such statements are given based on statistics and we know that the data contains noise. If we give an assessment based on these statistics, we will ignore the underlying  economic forces . Those underlying forces help us in determining the path of economy. 
 By looking at the trade statistics from July to December 2020, a key point that emerges is that the agriculture sector is under stress. For instance, the government imported a hefty volume of wheat in the current financial year, while it exported a reasonable volume in the last financial year. 
 In addition, it has already imported sugar in a large quantity, while the import quantity was negligible in FY 2019-20. In the previous year, we exported the commodity by granting subsidy and the next year, we have already imported the same one. 
 Nothing new about this practice since it has happened in the past as well on a number of occasions. 
 If anybody comes up with an economic description, he/she will say the country needs dollars desperately, therefore it exported the surplus quantity by granting timely subsidy. 
 Furthermore, it is not easy to keep these commodities since they entail storage and warehousing cost. 
 On the contrary, a political economist will take a critical view of this kind of situation. He would argue these steps have been taken to benefit the business elite, while masses will pay the cost. 
 Therefore, the benefits are concentrated in a few hands, while costs are dispersed across the masses. Hence, words like sugar barons and wheat mafia will gain currency in the print and electronic media. 
 Whatsoever the explanation of this situation, we cannot play down the significance of these two commodities as they are consumed by the masses. These commodities play a major role in increasing food inflation in the country. 
 In addition, these commodities will put pressure on the wages of labourers which will further add to the cost of production for the labour-intensive manufacturing operations. 
 Turning to cotton imports, which have gone up in the current financial year since domestic production of 15 million bales could not be achieved. In order to address the acute shortage of cotton, manufacturers in the supply chain have resorted to imports. 
 Pakistan ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s textile exports are around 60% of the total merchandise shipments. Keeping in view the pent-up export orders, the exporters will face supply chain issues in the absence of locally produced cotton. 
 Export data reveals that rice exports came down by 10% in quantitative terms in July-December 2020. 
 This reduction also indicates that there is something wrong with the  agricultural situation . 
 Briefly, the economy is in a recovery phase. The neglect of the agriculture sector by the successive governments will create headwinds for the exporters. 
 Although food inflation has come down to some extent due to imports, the situation will put pressure on the precious foreign exchange and even stall the recovery. 
 In the absence of structural reforms in the agriculture sector, the firefighting will keep on going.

SoftBank's Son hails 'golden eggs' as Vision Fund rallies,2021-02-08,Business Recorder,"TOKYO: SoftBank Group Corp Chief Executive Masayoshi Son boasted of delivering ""golden eggs"" on Monday, after his company's Vision Fund unit rebounded from a loss to record an 844 billion yen ($8 billion) third quarter profit.The profit marks a sea change from a year earlier when high-profile misses such as the flopped IPO of office sharing firm WeWork and the COVID-19 pandemic forced Son to sell assets to stabilise his investing empire.""Our vision never changed,"" Son told a news conference in Tokyo after his company announced its latest results. ""Golden eggs are not produced by chance,"" he added, returning to a favoured analogy that describes SoftBank as a goose that backs fast-growing companies such as Alibaba that are its golden eggs.One of Japan's wealthiest people, Son is viewed as a maverick in a business culture that generally eschews risk taking. Rock bottom interest rates and frothy markets that have driven tech stock gains have helped the turnaround at his Vision Fund unit.Softbank-backed firms that went public during the quarter include selling platform Opendoor and food delivery app operator Doordash, with unrealised gains in the latter totalling $10.7 billion.  Son, who was dressed in a white turtleneck and dark suit, said he had turned to back-to-back online meetings to run his investing empire during the pandemic.Almost half of the first Vision Fund's portfolio, which includes a stake in Uber Technologies, was exited or listed at the end of December, offering liquidity to the fund backed by the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.The $100 billion Vision Fund's 82 investments were valued at $90 billion, compared with their purchase price of $76.3 billion. The fund has recorded $20.4 billion in gross gains since inception.Vision Fund 2's 26 investments were valued at $9.3 billion compared with their purchase price of $4.3 billion. SoftBank is currently the fund's only investor.Portfolio companies held 28 funding rounds during 2020 with almost all led by investors other that SoftBank, reflecting the appetite for technology startups.""You wouldn't say Vision Fund is laying rotten eggs,"" Son said, who waved his arms like a music conductor standing before an animation of golden eggs emerging from a cartoon goose.Softbank's trading unit SB Northstar, which has been investing the group's cash reserves, disclosed stakes in listed tech stocks including American Despository Receipts in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co worth $22 billion at the end of December.The unit booked a $2.7 billion derivative loss during the quarter. Son said SB Northstar's performance has improved since the start of the year and that it is still in a trial phase.Chinese regulators halted the bumper IPO of Alibaba's fintech affiliate Ant in November. Son, whose shares in Alibaba are his largest asset, said China is becoming more concerned about antitrust and financial regulation but this is necessary for companies that will continue to grow.Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who has been mostly out of the public eye since the IPO halt, has been drawing pictures and sending them to Son, he said. The Japanese billionaire said he has also been drawing before bed.During the third quarter, Softbank Group's net profit ballooned more than 20 times to 1.17 trillion yen ($11.09 billion).

The report presents a general picture of decay and obliteration of two of the four most revered evacuee sites in Pakistan and their photographs have been attached to the report. The one-man commission has been established by the Supreme Court but it has three supporting members, MNA Dr Ramesh Vankwani, Saqib Jillani and the attorney general for Pakistan, who has nominated the deputy attorney general to participate in fact-finding activities of the commission. The report has requested the Supreme Court to direct the ETPB to get involved in the reconstruction of the desecrated Teri Mandir/Samaadhi and cooperate with the Khyber PakhÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½tunÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½khwa government for efficient implementation of the directives given by the apex court from time to time.

It suggested an amendment to the ETPB Act to establish a working group for rehabilitation of the holy sites belonging to Hindus and Sikhs. The report has said the Supreme Court had in its order of January 5 directed the ETPB Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½to submit a detailed report of all temples, Gurdawaras and other religious sites all over Pakistan which come under the purview of ETPBÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½.

Regarding mandir and samadhi in Teri, the report stated that after partition and resultant migration of Hindus to India, the local Muslims of Teri illegally occupied the entire mandir/samaadhi property. However, the ETPB remained unmoved.In 1997, the Hindu community struck a deal with one of the illegal occupants to at least open up a passage to the samaadhi. But again the ETPB did not bother to get the possession of the samaadhi. When the samaadhi was desecrated/demolished in August 1997, the ETPB even failed to lodge an FIR of such a tragic incident, and it was only after orders of the Supreme Court in 2015 that the board got the possession from illegal occupant, but not without active support of the Hindu community. However, after handing over possession of just 1,604 sq-ft area to the Hindu community, the ETPB was never seen at the site of samaadhi, the report said. Nor did the ETPB bother to explore the actual area of mandir/rsuance by the Hindu community. Even when nudged by the Supreme Court to start work for restoration of Teri Mandir/Samaadhi, the ETPB did not give any response for months. The commission has reported that the ETPB has yet to reimburse the renovation expenses amounting to Rs38 million, after subtracting Rs2m paid by KP government. The report alleged that the ETPB was only interested in occupation of valuable properties of migrated minorities, even after passage of more than 73 years, and charitable, worship and other joint properties of minority communities in hundreds of towns have been taken over by the ETPB.Published in Dawn, February 8th, 2021","hindus holy sites a picture of ISLAMABAD the seventh report of the one-man dr shoaib suddle commission submitted to the supreme court has depicted a dismal picture of most revered hindu sites in the country. the report submitted to the apex court on february 5 regrets that the evacuee trust property board (ETPB) has failed to maintain most of the ancient and holy sites of the minority community. the commission visited katas raj mandir in chakwal on january 6 and prahlad mandir in multan on january 7. the report presents a general picture of decay and obliteration of two of the four most revered evacuee sites in pakistan and their photographs have been attached to the report. the one-man commission has been established by the supreme court but it has three supporting members, MNA dr ramesh vankwani, saqib jillani and the attorney general for pakistan, who has nominated the deputy attorney general to participate in fact-finding activities of the commission. the report has requested the supreme court to direct the ETPB to get involved in the reconstruction of the desecrated teri Mandir/Samaadhi and cooperate with the khyber pakhtunkhwa government for efficient implementation of the directives given by the apex court from time to time. report by Shoaib-led body submitted to supreme CourtThe report has suggested collaborative efforts in the renovation of teri mandir (Karak), katas raj temples (Chakwal), prahlad mandir (Multan) and hinglaj mandir (Lasbela). it suggested an amendment to the ETPB act to establish a working group for rehabilitation of the holy sites belonging to hindus and sikhs. the report has said the supreme court had in its order of january 5 directed the ETPB to submit a detailed report of all temples, gurdawaras and other religious sites all over pakistan which come under the purview of ETPB. the commission approached the ETPB on january 12 to get the requisite information within a weeke 21, but no response was received. finally, the ETPB responded on january 25, but ignored the commissions format comprising six tables, thus evading the details. according to the ETPB letter, out of 365 mandirs only 13 were being managed by them, leaving responsibility of 65 with the hindu community, and practically abandoning the rest of 287 to the land mafias. it is indeed strange that even in this age of technology, the ETPB has yet to get the evacuee properties geo-tagged, the report highlighted. the report has said that the ETPB, with its staff spread across the country and boasting huge paraphernalia, was managing 31 places of worship out of a total of 470.the commission has raised objections over the ETPBs response that non-functional Mandirs/Gurdawaras existed due to lack of population of Hindus/Sikhs. however, therat teri in karak district of KP., the report said. regarding mandir and samadhi in teri, the report stated that after partition and resultant migration of hindus to india, the local muslims of teri illegally occupied the entire mandir/samaadhi property. however, the ETPB remained unmoved.in 1997, the hindu community struck a deal with one of the illegal occupants to at least open up a passage to the samaadhi. but again the ETPB did not bother to get the possession of the samaadhi. when the samaadhi was desecrated/demolished in august 1997, the ETPB even failed to lodge an FIR of such a tragic incident, and it was only after orders of the supreme court in 2015 that the board got the possession from illegal occupant, but not without active support of the hindu community. however, after handing over possession of just 1,604 sq-ft area to the hindu community, the ETPB was never seen at the site of samaadhi, the report said. nor did the ETPB bother to explore the actual area of mandir/rsuance by the hindu community. even when nudged by the supreme court to start work for restoration of teri Mandir/Samaadhi, the ETPB did not give any response for months. the commission has reported that the ETPB has yet to reimburse the renovation expenses amounting to rs 38 million, after subtracting rs 2m paid by KP government. the report alleged that the ETPB was only interested in occupation of valuable properties of migrated minorities, even after passage of more than 73 years, and charitable, worship and other joint properties of minority communities in hundreds of towns have been taken over by the ETPB."

The quality of a regimeÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s outcome depends on its actions whose quality, in turn, relies on its teamÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s quality. Outcomes include political, economic and foreign ones. Actions are in five governance areas: legislation, policy, institutional reform, projects and service delivery. Only major work in the first three areas gives big change but its fruits reach masses mainly via the last two. However, if done without the first three, the two give poor results. Seeing the PTIÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s weak team, I had said earlier that it canÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t keep its big promises. The team largely lacks skill. Some of the experience comes from failed actors of the past. New electables, allies or unelected advisers who lack party loyalty dominate the cabinet. The leadershipÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s claimed honesty helps little.

Its main policy is on construction, not industry, which may cause bubbles and non-transparency. Police, court, tax and state enterprise reforms are on hold. Frequent political transfers have hurt institutions. The bureaucratic reforms unveiled are largely seen as weak and education reforms as regressive. But IPP contract reforms may yet work. Halfway into the PTIÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s term, true change is still not visible.Even the governmentÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s own key change claims are on projects and services.

But no project is giving much-needed quick economic boost. CPEC and Karachi are stuck. Peshawar BRT had big delays, cost overruns and technical hitches. In servir, cash relief via BISP was apt.The Sehat scheme is a good one but has issues too. It covered 51pc KP families by 2016 and recently announced the extension of health coverage to all KP residents. Given high disease rates, this means access/ supply issues. The insurer must pay up to Rs1 million per family yearly in expenses against Rs2,849 premiums from KP. Less lavish market plans start at Rs50,000 given cost realities and small insured pools. But the captive state insurer may go broke despite a large pool if usage spikes. The PTI calls Ehsaas a big step-up on BISP with 140 initiatives. Its website shows eight actual programmes (sans one-off Covid relief). Two BISP ones still make up the bulk of its budget. Langar and ration programmes have only data portals for private entities. Amdan, Loan, Nashonuma and Scholarship programmes, the only new funded ones that partly build on BISP, may do well but are still too new to be judged. Unclear website data hinders review. Without work on the key governance areas, such work may be of poor quality. So without public hospital reforms Sehat patients may still get poor services. Given weak actions, outcomes fall below pre-2018 levels on dollar GDP and per capita income, GDP growth, inflation, jobs, tax revenue, fiscal deficit, interest rate, exchange rate, foreign reserves, exports, foreign investment, debt and poverty, arguably more due to government actions than Covid-19 or past-era mismanagement.

Terrorism fell. Foreign ties and economic indices were better. Despite many gaps we were slowly going ahead. But the slogan of tabdeeli has mainly been U-turns and reversals.

PTI dragging establishment into politics: PDM,2021-02-09,Tribune,"HYDERABAD:Leaders of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) have blamed the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for dragging the ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœmilitary establishmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â into the power politics while also asking the later to admit and apologise for their past mistakes of political adventurism.Addressing a public meeting in Hyderabad on Tuesday, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, Jamiat Ulema-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief and PDM President Maulana Fazlur Rehman and others asserted that they had always opposed the armyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s involvement in politics.Tens of thousands of supporters of the PDMÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s allied parties, with a far larger presence of the PPP supporters, attended the event organised by the PPP at a ground on the Hyderabad bypass. Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Vice President Maryam Nawaz was scheduled to address the gathering but she did not attend due to the accident of her daughter.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœAre those dragging them into politics who say in their public meetings that you [the army] have no role in politics and that you should keep away from politics and that all institutions should work as per their constitutional mandate?ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â asked Bilawal.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœOr those people drag them into politics who fight elections with their support, who ask them to make them victorious in the elections, who want deployment of the army inside and outside the polling stations.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂHe went on to contend that the PTI even urged the establishment to handle the media, support them in passing the budget, to handle differences with friendly countries, support the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) legislation, help create consensus over Gilgit-Baltistan and help them in the Senate polls.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWhen they [PTI] see their defeat; when they know that the people are not standing with them; when they realise that with your votes they canÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t make government and come to the power than they drag the establishment in politics.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂBilawal said that the people should be trusted for their wisdom in electing their representatives and their decisions should be accepted. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe people should be given permission to take decisions for their future,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he added.Bilawal reiterated that Prime Minister Imran Khan was responsible for the economic crisis, inflation, unemployment and the growing corruption as identified in the Transparency InternationalÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s latest report.Also read: Bilawal asks establishment to stay out of politicsHe again rapped ImranÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s knuckles for his statement in which he had said that Sindh was not their province. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœBalochistan, Punjab, K-P [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa], Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir are also not your provinces,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he charged.The PPP chairman alleged that Imran only wanted SindhÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s natural resources, tax revenue and the islands and not the province or its people. According to him, around 50% households or the people in half of Pakistan are facing malnutrition because of ImranÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s governance.He also blamed the PTIÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s government for being anti-poor and pro-rich. The prime minister was also accused of the ongoing anti-encroachment operations in the province, though, those were being carried out on the Supreme CourtÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s order.Referring to the accountability process, Bilawal lamented that Imran was not questioned for the alleged corruption in Bus Rapid Transport (BRT) project, foreign funding case, Malam Jabba, billion-tree project and Aleema KhanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s sewing machines controversy.The PPPÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s chairman informed the gathering that he would set off for the long march next month from Karachi. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThere will be a march in the month of March ... we will oust the selected, inept and illegal PM and will form the peoplesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ government.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂRehman, the PDM and JUI-F chief, said they also wanted to see the army to remain impartial in the political matters. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWhen do we want the army to get involved in politics or play a role other than defence [of the country],ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he asked. He added that mistakes of the militaryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s intervention in politics had been made and that should be admitted, followed by an apology to the nation.Rehman asked the establishment to reply why did they implicitly mock the opposition parties and congratulated the PTI after the 2018 general elections if they were not involved in rigging the polls and in giving power to Khan.

'Imran promised Naya Pakistan but it turned out to be expensive Pakistan': Bilawal at PDM's Hyderabad rally,2021-02-09,Dawn,"PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Tuesday once again hit out at the government over inflation and allegedly usurping the rights of provinces, saying Prime Minister Imran Khan had promised a Naya Pakistan ""but it turned out to be more expensive Pakistan"". He was speaking in Hyderabad where leaders of the 10-party opposition alliance, Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), had gathered for its latest power show against the government.Bilawal was joined on the stage by JUI-F Senator Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri and other opposition leaders. A massive crowd had gathered at the venue to hear the leaders speak, many waving PPP party flags.PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz, who has delivered fierce speeches against the government at previous PDM public meetings, did not attend the gathering as she was with her daughter who recently underwent a surgery after suffering head injuries in a road accident. PML-N Vice President and PDM secretary general Shahid Khaqan Abbasi attended the public meeting and addressed the crowd. In his speech, Bilawal alleged that the prime minister had refused to accept Sindh as his province and asked: ""If Sindh is not a province of the prime minister, then whose is it?""Terming the government ""puppet, selected and formed as a result of rigging"", he said none of the provinces and even Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir belonged to Prime Minister Imran.""He (Imran) neither needs Sindh nor Sindh's people but he wants Sindh's islands, gas, coal, tax revenue, the money you give, but he cannot spend on you or solve your problems or get you employment. He can only rob your rights but you, the people of this country will not tolerate him. We will protect our rights and our democracy and make this PM run away,"" the PPP leader said.He claimed that Sindh had been given Rs160 billion less than its due share last year and was being given Rs200bn less this year.""Think, if your right was given, the full Rs200bn were given, how much employment we could have provided to the youth of Hyderabad, how many health centres could be set up,"" Bilawal told the crowd. ""This is not Imran Khan's money, this is the money of the people of Hyderabad and we will go to Islamabad and take back our right from them.""He said the ""incompetent"" and ""illegitimate"" government had brought a tsunami of inflation with it and food items like wheat and sugar were beyond the people's purchasing power. ""Imran promised to bring a Naya Pakistan [but] it turned out to be a more expensive Pakistan. This is only because these illegitimate rulers were installed on us.""Bilawal said farmers in the country were protesting and they were not being paid for produce such as tomatoes and onions because the government preferred to import instead of buying from them. ""Imran's tabdeeli (change) has brought so much inflation, unemployment and poverty in the last year that half of Pakistan's families have food deficiency,"" he said, accusing the government of bringing relief to the rich and causing pain to the poor.""This is the same government that promised one crore jobs. I ask the people of Hyderabad whether they have gotten even one job from those one crore jobs.""This is the same Imran Khan who promised he would build five million houses. Is he not stealing the roof from over people's houses? Have you been given even one house?"" the PPP chairperson asked the audience.He further said Prime Minister Imran had said he would rather ""commit suicide"" than go to the IMF but ""he has taken so many loans in the last three years that even if you combine the loans of all previous governments, the figure would be less [than now].""He alleged that there was corruption in matters concerning the Peshawar Bus Rapid Transit project, Billion Tree Tsunami project, Malam Jabba project, Aleema Khanum's ""sewing machines"" and Papa Johns pizza scandal, but nobody asked the government questions about them.""You are bearing the burden of their incompetence in your electricity, gas and grocery bills,"" Bilawal told the crowd. ""He (Imran) has destroyed the economy, taken out the funeral of Pakistan's democracy and locked Pakistan's journalists and legal institutions. For how long will we tolerate this puppet government and experiments?""He said the government wanted the opposition not to drag the establishment into politics, but claimed that while the PDM demanded the establishment to stay out of politics in every rally, the government ""does politics while grasping their hand and fights elections while holding their hand"". Bilawal alleged that the government also sought the establishment's help to ""handle media"" on its behalf, as well as to get its budget passed, deal with disgruntled friendly nations, getting the FATF legislation passed, building consensus on the issue of GB, and for the upcoming Senate elections.""When they see their defeat, when they know people are not standing with them, when they realise they cannot [...] come into power because of your votes, then the establishment is dragged into politics,"" Bilawal said, referring to the government. ""We do not drag it, it is dragged by them.""He emphasised that the PPP's narrative was that ""every institution should do its work and leave politics to politicians and trust the people of Pakistan""While concluding his speech, Bilawal said people from across the country will leave for the PDM march scheduled for next month and ""We will take out these incompetent and selected from the government.""'2018's corona'Addressing the rally next, PDM president Maulana Fazlur Rehman said the public meeting was being held to ""restore the free air of democracy"".

If you think the people of Pakistan are your enemies, be clear about it.""This politics will not continue, we have raised our voice for our right and will continue raising it until the time all institutions start working according to the Constitution,"" the JUI-F chief said.Accusing the government of having ""bankrupted"" the country, the PDM chief asked the government how it would provide 10 million jobs when it ""[did not] have the money to pay government employees"".Speaking about the upcoming Senate polls, Rehman claimed that ""a big plan"" was being made for rigging the elections in the same way as 2018. He said the government was confused and had first announced an amendment for open Senate polls before the matter landed in the Supreme Court. ""I would request the court not to make itself a part of this. They themselves have said the Constitution is silent on this, which cannot be broken by anyone other than the parliament.

Sindh farmers await wheat policy,2021-02-09,Tribune,"Growers concerned as crop harvest to begin in two weeks
Though wheat harvest is expected to commence in the next two weeks in  Sindh,  the provincial government has not yet announced the wheat procurement policy, leaving farmers perplexed. 
 In a meeting with the Sindh Abadgar Board, the farmers voiced concern that wheat harvest in Sindh was to start within 15 days but the Sindh government had not yet announced the  procurement policy . 
 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœProcurement price of wheat should be notified by the province,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â emphasised Sindh Abadgar Board Senior Vice President Mahmood Nawaz Shah. 
 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWheat procurement policy is important to keep a balance between demand and supply.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â 
 When farmers do not get a fair price, they hold back the commodity for fetching better prices. However, this leads to imbalance in the market and prices increase for end-consumers. 
 The current wheat price in the market is Rs2,200 per 40 kg, but according to a recommendation of the Sindh government, the price should be fixed at Rs2,000, said Shah. 
 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThis will ensure abundant wheat supply for procurement and discourage  hoarding  as happened in the past two years.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â 
 The provincial and federal governments should resolve differences on the procurement price at the earliest, remarked Sindh Abadgar Board member Dr Bashir Nizamani. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWheat procurement should start by the first week of March,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he added. 
 Endorsing NizamaniÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s views, another member Syed Nadeem Shah said there should not be a ban on the movement of wheat as the administrative and arbitrary measure had worked in favour of hoarders in the past and neither helped the growers nor the consumers. 
 The procurement process should be completed transparently and stakeholders should be involved in it, Shah stressed, adding that the procurement target should be increased to benefit the consumers, as it was one of the supply balancing measures to control rising prices of flour. 
 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWe urge the government of Sindh to prepare a procurement plan as early as possible, so that last yearÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s situation does not repeat - when Rs30 billion was siphoned off,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said. 
 It was due to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœprice difference as wheat was procured from farmers at Rs35 per kg and was sold in the open market at Rs60 per kg,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said. 
 Vegetables policy The absence of a policy and the knee-jerk reaction have led to a situation where farmers are facing losses on onion, tomato, cauliflower, cabbage and other vegetablesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ supply. 
 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe current wholesale price of onion is Rs8 per kg, tomato Rs6 per kg, cauliflower Rs3 per kg and cabbage Rs5 per kg,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â Shah added. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœLack of attention to the horticulture sector exposes farmers to a high risk of price crash,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he lamented. 
 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœLast year when onion production was in full swing during October, the government created hurdles to export,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â Shah said, adding that as a result, PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economy lost an opportunity to earn foreign exchange and onion prices went down from Rs40 to Rs8 per kg (for farmers). 
 Moreover, onion imports did not stop. In the case of tomato, imports continued till the point prices crashed. In other countries, the risk of price crash is reduced by processing and facilities for storage and export. 
 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœUnfortunately, in Pakistan there is no policy to encourage processing and export of vegetables,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœFarmers, therefore, face all the losses","sindh farmers await wheat policy growers concerned as crop harvest to begin in two weeks though wheat harvest is expected to commence in the next two weeks in sindh, the provincial government has not yet announced the wheat procurement policy, leaving farmers perplexed. in a meeting with the sindh abadgar board, the farmers voiced concern that wheat harvest in sindh was to start within 15 days but the sindh government had not yet announced the procurement policy . procurement price of wheat should be notified by the province, emphasised sindh abadgar board senior vice president mahmood nawaz shah. wheat procurement policy is important to keep a balance between demand and supply. when farmers do not get a fair price, they hold back the commodity for fetching better prices. however, this leads to imbalance in the market and prices increase for end-consumers. the current wheat price in the market is rs 2,200 per 40 kg, but according to a recommendation of the sindh government, the price should be fixed at rs 2,000, said shah. this will ensure abundant wheat supply for procurement and discourage hoarding as happened in the past two years. the provincial and federal governments should resolve differences on the procurement price at the earliest, remarked sindh abadgar board member dr bashir nizamani. wheat procurement should start by the first week of march, he added. endorsing nizamanis views, another member syed nadeem shah said there should not be a ban on the movement of wheat as the administrative and arbitrary measure had worked in favour of hoarders in the past and neither helped the growers nor the consumers. the procurement process should be completed transparently and stakeholders should be involved in it, shah stressed, adding that the procurement target should be increased to benefit the consumers, as it was one of the supply balancing measures to control rising prices of flour. we urge the government of sindh to prepare a procurement plan as early as possible, so that last years situation does not repeat - when rs 30 billion was siphoned off, he said. it was due to the price difference as wheat was procured from farmers at rs 35 per kg and was sold in the open market at rs 60 per kg, he said. vegetables policy the absence of a policy and the knee-jerk reaction have led to a situation where farmers are facing losses on onion, tomato, cauliflower, cabbage and other vegetables supply. the current wholesale price of onion is rs 8 per kg, tomato rs 6 per kg, cauliflower rs 3 per kg and cabbage rs 5 per kg, shah added. lack of attention to the horticulture sector exposes farmers to a high risk of price crash, he lamented. last year when onion production was in full swing during october, the government created hurdles to export, shah said, adding that as a result, pakistans economy lost an opportunity to earn foreign exchange and onion prices went down from rs 40 to rs 8 per kg (for farmers). moreover, onion imports did not stop. in the case of tomato, imports continued till the point prices crashed. in other countries, the risk of price crash is reduced by processing and facilities for storage and export. unfortunately, in pakistan there is no policy to encourage processing and export of vegetables, he said. farmers, therefore, face all the losses"

The meeting was also attended by Secretary Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sohail Mehmood and Secretary Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis Dr. Hashim Popalzai.Dr. Farogh Naseem apprised the representatives from Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Overseas Pakistanis about the usefulness of the system developed with the help of National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA). He said 95% of the cases involving transfer of immovable and movable property of the deceased are not disputed and can be resolved within days. He said many legal heirs who live abroad could not visit Pakistan to obtain letters of Administration and Succession Certificates previously because they were required to be present in Pakistan, at the same time along with the other legal heirs, which was practically difficult. He said the system that had been developed with assistance from NADRA would make it convenient for the overseas Pakistanis to obtain Letters of Administration and Succession Certificates with the help of biometric verification at the Pakistani Missions Abroad.

Private firms to import LNG by April,2021-02-10,Tribune,"SAPM informs ADB about progress on reforms in petroleum sector
ISLAMABAD:
 
 Private companies will be able to bring and sell  liquefied natural gas  (LNG) to consumers of their choice by April this year, Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Petroleum Nadeem Babar told a delegation of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). 
 He said that Pakistan had fully implemented the third-party access policy in order to utilise the idle capacity of LNG terminals with the help of private companies. 
 In this regard, the cabinet on Tuesday approved the allocation of LNG terminal and pipeline capacity on a three-month rolling basis to the private sector for LNG import and marketing. 
 Earlier, the  Cabinet Committee on Energy  (CCOE) had approved the allocation of pipeline capacity for three months. It will be open for all sectors including the compressed natural gas (CNG) filling stations. 
 The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has already allowed the issuance of CNG station licences based on LNG supply following the opening of LNG market for the private sector. 
 At present, two LNG terminals are functioning. The CNG sector is receiving gas supplies from state-run gas companies. However, it wants to import LNG at competitive rates. 
 After approval of the cabinet, the LNG market will be open for the private sector, which will provide an opportunity for the consumers to bring gas at competitive prices. 
 Babar made the remarks at a virtual meeting on Tuesday with the ADB team in Manila together with ADB Country Director Xiaohong Yang and their energy team. 
 The meeting was aimed at discussing progress on the reform programme in the petroleum sector of Pakistan. Energy sector reforms are part of the governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s policy to improve energy economics and secure oil and gas supplies across the country. 
 In his opening remarks, the SAPM said that the government had made significant progress on every aspect of energy reforms despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 Babar told ADB officials that the third-party access (TPA) policy had been fully implemented, adding that TPA was also available for pipelines and the government had advertised the unutilised capacity of terminals to enable private companies to bring and sell LNG to consumers of their own choice by April 2021. 
 Talking about exploration and production (E&P) activities, the SAPM said that the first bidding round for 15 onshore oil and gas blocks had been completed. 
 He said that the minimum investment to be made by E&P companies in conducting studies and examination of the blocks would be around $71 million over three years. 
 It would be followed by investment running into hundreds of millions of dollars in the development programme in areas close to the oil and gas blocks. He voiced hope that the second and third rounds of bidding would be completed by the end of current year. 
 The SAPM pointed out that the government had prepared a regulatory framework for the upstream petroleum sector and it would be put in place after approval by the Council of Common Interests (CCI) and necessary legislation. 
 Talking about unaccounted for gas (UFG), Babar said that both Sui companies had made significant progress on the UFG reduction plan. 
 The SAPM appreciated the ADB support for hiring a consultant and the study on establishing strategic underground gas storages. 
 He underlined the importance of underground gas storage facilities, saying that the project would enhance the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s capability to import gas and ensure sustainable economic growth.

A huge sum of government funds was being drained and going in the air for the last many years but since the money did not belong to the secretaries they were not bothered, the chief justice deplored. Mr Soomro explained that the SVP scheme had been designed in the absence of working and the government was negotiating with several interested parties from China, Korea and Russia etc. When the chief justice recalled the 2,006 apex court judgement against privatisation of the PSM, Planning and Development Minister Asad Uavoid violation of the verdict the SPV was being created and the PSM was being leased through competitive bidding. Advocate Shahid Amjad Bajwa informed the court that according to experts, $500m was needed to revive the mills to its original production capacity of 1.1m tons per annum, $750m to enhance it to 2m tons and $900m to $1 billion to further increase the capacity to 3m tons per annum. Justice Ijaz-ul-Ahsan, a member of the bench, regretted that for the last many years the state enterprise was on government grants and thus bleeding the economy and as the time passed, it added to the losses of the mill.

When thwas keeping its workers and why its chairman was roaming around abroad, the chief justice wondered. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Since we are at the receiving end and at the disadvantaged position, the investor may dictate its own terms during negotiations,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ he feared. The chief justice was worried that the negotiations on the steels mill might end up in international arbitration like in many other cases.  He was also bitter that all state enterprises, including the Heavy Mechanical Complex, Karachi Shipyard and PIA, were shutting down one by one. The Supreme Court appointed senior counsel Rashid A.

The plan will be placed before the court in two weeks. Meanwhile in its report, the PSM stated that the Privatisation Commission planned to undertake pre-qualification of investorst and statements of qualification, and then invite pre-qualified interested parties. The commission envisaged, the report said, to conduct bidding for the SPV in the third quarter of 2,021 and the financial closure and commencement of the business would depend on timelines agreed to with successful bidder in the share purchase agreement.

"Humayun Saeed, Adnan Siddiqui spill the details on upcoming Pakistani-Turkish series Turki Lala",2021-02-10,Dawn,"Sit in a room with Humayun Saeed and Adnan Siddiqui together and youÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ll often find it hard to wedge a word in. The conversation is free-flowing, ricocheting between serious issues to wild anecdotes, peppered with loud bouts of laughter.There are so many mutual acquaintances that they keep referring to and so many memories that they share, through the eras of Pakistani TV history, as heroes who have rivaled each other for roles and friends who have co-starred in multiple major hits.To be honest, while interviewing them, there were times when I didnÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t even really want to pitch questions, simply enjoying the chemistry between two of PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s biggest superstars.Having interviewed Humayun and Adnan individually many times before, IÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½m well-attuned to their professional visions and personal idiosyncrasies. But talking to the both of them, together, is a first. Our meeting has been organised with the intention ofurkeyÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s Tekdin Films, one of the producers behind the colossally popular Dirilis: Ertugrul series.In retrospect, though, I wonder why this project had to be the impetus for a joint story on the two. Humayun and AdnanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s mutual history and riveting repartee should have been reason enough for an interview even before the collaboration with Turkey came along.

Of course it was.Things turned serious, thkdin Films, TRT Films and Dr Kashif Ansari of Ansari Films. Adnan and Humayun have come on board as executive producers within Ansari Films.Turki Lala, the detailsSet in the Indo-Pak Subcontinent and Turkey during the Khilafat Movement in the early 20th century, the series will recount the story of Turki Lala or Abdur Rehman Peshawari, whose family had migrated from Kashmir and settled in Peshawar, in what was British India at the time.Peshawari was studying at Aligarh University around the time the Khilafat Movement began to gain momentum. Leaving his studies, he dedicated himself to gathering support and funds from like-minded people, and journeyed to Turkey to fight for the Ottoman Empire in the Balkan war.Later, as a member of the Turkish army, he took part in two more wars, before AtaturkÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s government sent him to Afghanistan as an envoy. There, he became well-known as Turki Lala, but was assassinated shortly afterwards due to a case of mistaken identity.The story, encapsulated ied to span three seasons, with 30 episodes each. Traversing both Pakistani soil as well as Turkey, it fits well as a joint narrative between both countries. And as Humayun and Adnan enthusiastically point out, the potential it holds for PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s entertainment industry is immense.

he is an overseas pakistani who wants to invest and support our local talent, says Adnan.Humayun adds, there are so many pakistanis living abroad who want to support pakistan on an international level. they are on the lookout for investments that could build pakistans image and economy. once turki lala gets underway, I predict that well see many more foreign investors reaching out to local producers and directors. theres more. working with an accomplished international team will also help us learn more of our craft, continues humayun. the series may serve as a benchmark and introduce a range of new ideas. it mayand mohammad bin Qasim.No historical series has been produced in recent times because our audience is now accustomed to watching international content. any [individual] effort on our part, with our limited budgets, would have looked lacklustre in comparison.nevertheless, do they have apprehensions that this drama may turn out to be too much like ertugrul? the historic series, dubbed in urdu, has only just wrapped up airing on the state-owned pakistan television network (PTV) and, given its popularity, the audience may draw comparisons.how will it be too much like ertugrul? humayun is incredulous. this series will be set in the early 1900s while ertugruls story dated back to the 13th century! turki lalas story is not just relevant to the ottoman dynasty but also to us, lithe time.the man was a resident of peshawar, chips in humayun. his historic contributions are one of the factors that strengthen our ties with turkey. even the turkish prime minister mentioned him in a speech.for the love of PakistanGiven the involvement of tekdin films, can we hope to see a strong contingent of pakistani actors in the series or is it likely that the cast will be predominantly turkish?

Inflation spirals to 8.7% in February,2021-03-02,Tribune,"ISLAMABAD:The inflation rate spiralled to 8.7% in February - one of the steepest increases in a month - due to surge in prices of food and energy, beating expectations of the finance ministry in a report three days ago that predicted a low inflation reading.The 8.7% inflation was the highest in the past four months, which also reversed the downward trend in the inflation index, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported on Monday.PBS revealed that today electricity was 43% costlier than a year ago and almost all kitchen items recorded a double-digit rise in prices, including wheat, sugar, milk and wheat flour.The governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s claim of reducing inflation to the lowest level in its two-and-a-half-year tenure also proved to be short-lived after it increased electricity tariff coupled with a surge in commoditiesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ prices in the international and domestic markets.There was an increase of three percentage points in the pace of inflation last month, which was one of the fastest increases in the index.In January 2021, the inflation reading had slipped to 5.7%, which led to congratulatory tweets from Prime Minister Imran Khan and Planning Minister Asad Umar. The prime minister said that the Consumer Price Index and core inflation were ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœboth now lower than when our government was formedÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â.The February inflation reading has belied the government claim that inflation was at the lowest level in the two-and-a-half-year tenure of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) administration.The 8.7% inflation rate was significantly higher than the forecast of the Ministry of Finance that expected inflation to remain in a range of 5.5% to 7.5% in February just three days ago.In its monthly Economic Outlook report, the Ministry of Finance had also said that the future inflation rate may follow a lower path.The economic outlook seems to be following the political pulse rather than providing a credible assessment of major economic indicators.PBS reported that there was a significant increase in inflation in both urban and rural areas. The inflation rate in urban areas jumped to 8.6% in February, an increase of 3.6% in just one month. Similarly, in rural areas, the inflation rate increased to 8.8%.Food inflation also rose in both urban and rural areas. In cities, food inflation increased to double digits at 10.3%, according to the PBS. In rural areas, the food inflation was calculated at 9.1%.Core inflation - calculated by excluding food and energy items - jumped to an eight-month high at 6.4% in urban areas in February, said the PBS.The State Bank of Pakistan has been targeting the headline inflation to set its policy rate. In the last monetary policy statement, the central bank indicated no change in the policy rate for at least four months.The inflation index comprises 12 major groups with food and non-alcoholic beverages having maximum weight of 34.6% in the basket. The food group saw price increase of 8.7%. Within the food group, prices of non-perishable food items rose nearly 15% on an annualised basis.The major items that saw price increase were eggs 48%, chicken 36%, condiments and spices 31%, wheat 24%, mustard oil 23%, beans, sugar and vegetable ghee 17%, cooking oil 15.4%, milk 15% and wheat flour bag 13.5%.The double-digit increase in prices suggested that it was not easier for the middle and low-income groups to manage the kitchen with limited resources. However, the perishable food items recorded a price reduction of over 17%, said the PBS. Onion and tomato prices fell nearly 30% and vegetables 22.5%.The inflation rate for the housing, water, electricity, gas and fuel group - having one-fourth weight in the basket - was 10.6% last month.The PBS bulletin revealed that the government had increased electricity tariff by 43% last month on an annualised basis. Electricity charges went up 29.5% in February over January, according to the PBS.The cost of footwear also shot up nearly 30% last month as compared to the same period of previous year.

Mian Zahid Hussain said that the government had completed talks with the IPPs which would result in savings of Rs42 billion per annum, and now it had initiated talks with Chinese companies to reduce tariff, capacity charges and interest rates etc. which was according to the national interests. He said that power plants with a capacity of 16000 megawatts were planned under CPEC and projects with 6500 megawatts were expected to come online soon. This would result in the burden of hundreds of billions of rupees as the country was already producing surplus electricity, and completion of projects would push surplus power to 50 percent of the required electricity. Due to the sensitivity and importance of the issue, the prime minister and the COAS were personally handling the issue and trying to extend repayment duration from 10 to 20 years, he said. In case of success Pakistan would save $500 million per annum which would be a big relief while it may reduce the tariff of electricity which was very high as compared to competing nations, he said.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021","power sector marching towards unresolvable problems KARACHI chairman of national business group and president of pakistan businessmen and intellectuals forum mian zahid hussain has said that the power sector may crumble under the burden of defective planning and wrong contracts, and the business community hope that china will bail out pakistan from this mess.he said the power sector was marching towards un-resolvable problems while prime minister imran khan and COAS qamar javed bajwa were trying their best to tackle the issue which was highly laudable. mian zahid hussain said that the government had completed talks with the IPPs which would result in savings of rs 42 billion per annum, and now it had initiated talks with chinese companies to reduce tariff, capacity charges and interest rates etc. which was according to the national interests. he said that power plants with a capacity of 16000 megawatts were planned under CPEC and projects with 6500 megawatts were expected to come online soon. this would result in the burden of hundreds of billions of rupees as the country was already producing surplus electricity, and completion of projects would push surplus power to 50 percent of the required electricity. due to the sensitivity and importance of the issue, the prime minister and the COAS were personally handling the issue and trying to extend repayment duration from 10 to 20 years, he said. in case of success pakistan would save $500 million per annum which would be a big relief while it may reduce the tariff of electricity which was very high as compared to competing nations, he said."
Growing US-India partnership may further upset strategic balance in S. Asia to Pakistan's disadvantage,2021-03-02,Dawn,"THE inauguration of the Biden administration has predictably generated a heated debate on AmericaÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s likely policy concerning Pakistan. Any analysis of the emerging scenario must be firmly grounded in strategic realities rather than in wishful thinking.The end of the Cold War had already reduced PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s importance in AmericaÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s strategic calculations. On top of that, there is now growing strategic divergence between Pakistan and the US because of the development of the Indo-US partnership as an essential element of the US policy of containment of China, on the one hand, and the deepening cooperation between Pakistan and China on the other. CPEC is a prime example of growing Pakistan-China cooperation.Additional factors which will influence US policy on Pakistan are IndiaÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s economic weight with a GDP of $2.6 trillion, its increasing global political influence as evidenced by its current membership of the UNcks caused by the rise of Hindutva under Narendra Modi. By way of comparison, PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s economy is in dire straits with a GDP of only $285 billion, there is political instability and its journey as a functioning democracy has been interrupted several times in the past. Still, as a nuclear power with considerable military strength, PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s importance in strengthening regional peace and stability cannot be ignored.The Biden administrationÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s initial policy statements clearly show that it is determined to continue the policy of developing a strategic partnership with India in pursuit of the policy of containment of China. It is worth underscoring that the US policy of developing strategic cooperation with India had been supported by the Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump administrations. Unsurprisingly, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at his confirmation hearing stated that AmericaÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s relations with India w assured Congress that the Biden administration would Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½operationalise IndiaÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s Major Defence Partner statusÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½.How will US-India ties impact Pakistan?The increased presence of Americans of Indian origin in powerful positions in the Biden administration may reinforce the trend of deepening cooperation between the two countries, especially in military, nuclear and high-tech areas thereby upsetting further the strategic balance in South Asia to PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s disadvantage. In short, India is likely to be given the central role in the US Indo-Pacific strategy which will also involve the strengthening of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad involving India, Japan, US and Australia as affirmed by President Joe Biden in his recent telephone conversation with Prime Minister Modi.Consequently, it would be unrealistic to expect that under Biden, the US would resume large-scale economic and military assistance to Pakie with the UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people. The harsh reality is that America lacks both the will and the capacity to influence IndiaÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s position on the Kashmir dispute. It will, therefore, continue paying lip service to the need for a peaceful settlement of the Kashmir dispute while being supportive of Indian hegemonic designs in South Asia.However, there are several areas in which the two countries can engage in mutually beneficial cooperation. Currently, the Biden administration is reviewing the deal signed by the US and the Afghan Taliban in February last year aimed at American military withdrawal from Afghanistan, an end to terrorism originating from Afghanistan, and a peace settlement between the Taliban and the Kabul regime. It is in the mutual interest of Pakistan and the US to promote the ongoing intra-Afghan dialogue for achieving these goals. The same can be said about Pakistan-US cooperation for combating terrorism from which both grievously. Pakistan would be well advised to remove ambiguities in its policies concerning this issue.Other areas in which Pakistan and the US can engage in mutually beneficial cooperation are the prevention of nuclear proliferation, promotion of peace and stability in South Asia, the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean regions, climate change, promotion of human rights and strengthening of bilateral cooperation in economic, commercial, technical and cultural fields. The test of PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s diplomacy would lie in its ability to reconcile the elements of divergence and cooperation into a coherent whole mindful of both the potential and limitations of the Pakistan-US relationship.The writer is a retired ambassador and author.

An ironclad friendship growing stronger in the new era,2021-03-02,Tribune,"In commemoration of the 70th anniversary of China-Pakistan diplomatic relations On May 21, 1951, the PeopleÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan entered into formal diplomatic relations. In the seven decades ever since, the two countries have stood together, rain or shine, and built an exceptional, ironclad friendship. This friendship has become a strategic asset, most dearly cherished by both sides.China-Pakistan friendship has a time-honored history. As late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai said friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Pakistanis can be traced as far back as the dawn of history. Over 2,000 years ago, China and Pakistan were already connected by the ancient Silk Road, when our peoples visited each other amid echoes of camel bells. In the extended course of history thereafter, the friendship has steadily grown stronger and deeper.China-Pakistan friendship enjoys a solid foundation. We always support each other on our respective core interests and major concerns. Even at critical times, be it when New China endeavoured to break external blockade and make diplomatic opening, or when Pakistan stood up to crises to defend national dignity, we have always been there for each other, and have become true friends in need.China-Pakistan friendship has deep roots among the two peoples. In times of hardship, one always extends a helping hand to the other as early as possible. Such mutual support and assistance have no strings attached, and are pure acts of goodwill and friendship. When the great earthquake hit Wenchuan of China in 2008, Pakistan donated all its tents in reserve. When Pakistan suffered devastating floods in 2010, China launched the largest humanitarian operation in its history to help Pakistan from land and air. There are numerous touching stories like these. Indeed, developing China-Pakistan friendship is a nation-wide consensus in both countries.Since the turn of the century, the China-Pakistan relationship has grown even stronger, and cooperation has been upgraded across the board. In 2015, President Xi Jinping made a historic state visit to Pakistan. Leaders of the two countries agreed to elevate the relationship to an all-weather strategic cooperative partnership. This has opened up a new chapter of friendly interactions.High-level exchanges are frequent. The heads of state and government maintain communication via bilateral visits, by telephone calls and at multilateral events. Through timely, in-depth exchange of views on bilateral cooperation and major strategic issues of mutual interest, they keep the relationship in the right direction, give strategic guidance to its development and steadily make new progress in bilateral strategic cooperation.Practical cooperation is fruitful. We have put in place a ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœ1+4ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â cooperation structure that centers on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and prioritises the Gwadar Port, transportation infrastructure, energy and industrial cooperation. Under CPEC, 70 early-harvest projects have been identified, among which 46 have been launched or completed. A total of $25.4 billion has been invested, creating 70,000 jobs for Pakistan. CPEC, as a signature project under the Belt and Road Initiative, has served as a fine example as China and other Islamic countries work to synergize their development strategies.People-to-people exchanges are booming. We hold culture months, film weeks, tourism years and national promotion activities. Exchanges and cooperation are moving ahead in media, think-tank, academia, education, culture and sports. In the Year of China-Pakistan Friendly Exchanges in 2015, we held a series of cultural exchange events that took our friendship to a new high. Recent years have witnessed the highly popular 100-member youth groups exchange programme under the vision for a lasting friendship, enabling more and more Pakistani students to study in China. The ever-growing force for China-Pakistan friendship has been the firmest basis for our bilateral relations.Cooperation on multilateral occasions is close. We both observe the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, and have common values of advocating multilateralism over unilateralism, free trade over protectionism, and win-win over hegemony. We are both committed to upholding the existing international order and the UN-centred international system. And we both believe in peaceful settlement of international disputes through consultations and negotiations. China and Pakistan coordinate and collaborate closely in the UN, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Asia-Europe Meeting, the ASEAN Regional Forum, and other regional and international mechanisms. We have made important contributions to solving regional hotspot issues and advancing international counter-terrorism cooperation, and injected enormous positive energy into the cause of regional and global justice.Our friendship has withstood the test of the sudden onslaught of Covid-19, and has emerged even stronger. At the toughest moment of ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s battle against the coronavirus, Pakistan did all it could to provide China with donations. Pakistanis from all social sectors expressed unanimous support for ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Covid response, and opposed the attempt to politicise the virus and stigmatise China. When Covid cases surged in Pakistan, ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s government, military, businesses and social organisations all pitched in to help. China provided successive batches of medical supplies, sent medical teams, and intensified experience sharing and technological exchanges. In addition, our two countries established a joint response mechanism to ensure that all CPEC projects proceed uninterrupted, with no jobs cut and no staffs withdrawn. This set an example of effective transnational response to Covid-19.This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party of China. The country will embark on a new journey toward a modernised socialist country and realising the second centenary goal. Pakistan is advancing economic and social development in full speed and improving social welfare to turn into reality the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan for Naya Pakistan. As an all-weather strategic cooperative partner, China always gives priority to its cooperation with Pakistan in its overall external cooperation. We will continue to firmly support Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity; in deepening reform and opening wider and raising self-reliance ability; in enhancing political unity, national security and social stability; and in playing a bigger and constructive role in international and regional affairs.In a world of drastic changes unseen in a century, deepening China-Pakistan strategic cooperation is the natural option. No matter how the regional and international landscapes may evolve, and what challenges and risks may arise, China will continue to work with Pakistan to advance cooperation in all areas, cement our ironclad friendship, and build an even closer community with a shared future in the new era.During this year, China and Pakistan will inaugurate grand and warm celebrations to honour the 70th anniversary of diplomatic relations, including high-level visits, business exchanges and cultural activities. I hope that people from all walks of life of both countries, especially the younger generation, will take an active part in renewing the ironclad friendship to push forward our all-weather strategic cooperative partnership. I am confident that our joint efforts will usher in an even brighter future of China-Pakistan relations.Published in The Express Tribune, March 2nd, 2021.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook, follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.","an ironclad friendship growing stronger in the new era in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of China-Pakistan diplomatic relations on may 21, 1951, the peoples republic of china and the islamic republic of pakistan entered into formal diplomatic relations. in the seven decades ever since, the two countries have stood together, rain or shine, and built an exceptional, ironclad friendship. this friendship has become a strategic asset, most dearly cherished by both sides.China-Pakistan friendship has a time-honored history. as late chinese premier zhou enlai said friendly exchanges between the chinese and pakistanis can be traced as far back as the dawn of history. over 2,000 years ago, china and pakistan were already connected by the ancient silk road, when our peoples visited each other amid echoes of camel bells. in the extended course of history thereafter, the friendship has steadily grown stronger and deeper.China-Pakistan friendship enjoys a solid foundation. we always support each other on our respective core interests and major concerns. even at critical times, be it when new china endeavoured to break external blockade and make diplomatic opening, or when pakistan stood up to crises to defend national dignity, we have always been there for each other, and have become true friends in need.China-Pakistan friendship has deep roots among the two peoples. in times of hardship, one always extends a helping hand to the other as early as possible. such mutual support and assistance have no strings attached, and are pure acts of goodwill and friendship. when the great earthquake hit wenchuan of china in 2008, pakistan donated all its tents in reserve. when pakistan suffered devastating floods in 2010, china launched the largest humanitarian operation in its history to help pakistan from land and air. there are numerous touching stories like these. indeed, developing China-Pakistan friendship is a nation-wide consensus in both countries.since the turn of the century, the China-Pakistan relationship has grown even stronger, and cooperation has been upgraded across the board. in 2015, president xi jinping made a historic state visit to pakistan. leaders of the two countries agreed to elevate the relationship to an all-weather strategic cooperative partnership. this has opened up a new chapter of friendly interactions.High-level exchanges are frequent. the heads of state and government maintain communication via bilateral visits, by telephone calls and at multilateral events. through timely, in-depth exchange of views on bilateral cooperation and major strategic issues of mutual interest, they keep the relationship in the right direction, give strategic guidance to its development and steadily make new progress in bilateral strategic cooperation.practical cooperation is fruitful. we have put in place a 1+4 cooperation structure that centers on the China-Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC) and prioritises the gwadar port, transportation infrastructure, energy and industrial cooperation. under CPEC, 70 early-harvest projects have been identified, among which 46 have been launched or completed.

Tax-to-GDP ratio goes below average in 2 fiscal years: WB official,2021-03-02,Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: World BankÃ¢Â€Â™s senior tax specialist has pointed out that PakistanÃ¢Â€Â™s tax-to-GDP ratio dropped and went below average during the last two fiscal years. The overdependence on withholding taxes is also bad because these WHT have been converted into another kind of sales tax, the World BankÃ¢Â€Â™s   Senior Tax Specialist, Sebastian James, added.During the webinar organised by Pakistan Development Policy Series 2021 in collaboration with the World Bank on Monday, the Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Revenues, Dr Waqar Masood, said that the government was reforming the withholding tax regime.

"Only one veterinarian for 60k animals, PA told",2021-03-02,Tribune,"KARACHI:There is only one veterinarian for every 60,000 animals in the province, the Sindh Assembly was informed on Monday. During the question and answers session, Sindh Livestock and Fisheries Minister Abdul Bari Pitafi told the house that the province is facing a severe shortage of veterinary doctors and the Sindh government plans to appoint 527 doctors soon.""Currently we have around 850 doctors in Sindh. This ratio is meager compared to the total number of animals,"" the minister said while responding to a question. Announcing the provincial government's decision to hold the animal expo in Hyderabad, Pitafi said that the expo will be inaugurated by Pakistan Peoples Party Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Hyderabad where different breed of horses from all over Pakistan will participate in a three-day show to commence from March 13. The minister briefed the house about the European Union lifting the ban on exports of fish and its related products. Pitafi was of the view that the ban was slapped because of unhygienic conditions of seafood which led to huge economic loss. ""Although it is a federal government matter, we are pursuing it and have met the EU's requirement by developing better hygiene practices. The EU has lifted the ban and asked us to export fish and its related items,"" he informed the house. With regards to the measures taken by his department, the fisheries minister said that they have developed jetties and proper cooling stores to stock fish. ""We have also established jetties in Thatta, Badin and Sujawal, where the government also plans to set up ice-factories.""When asked about the fishermen village schemes for Manchhar and Keenjhar Lakes, the minister said that 75 per cent work has been finished on the schemes. There was a budget issue which is why development work was delayed, he added. ""We have asked the finance department to release funds. The pandemic has created the problem as most of the funds are diverted for Covid-19."" Heated exchange Earlier, as the session started with Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani in the chair, the house witnessed pandemonium for the third consecutive session. The situation became tense when Opposition Leader Haleem Adil Shaikh drew the Speaker's attention toward horse-trading in the forthcoming Senate elections. ""We have heard that an actual market has been set up for the sale and purchase of MPAs in Sindh to change the loyalty of lawmakers of this house,"" alleged Haleem. Referring to a viral video depicting exchange of money over Senate polls, Haleem said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-led federal government has taken the matter to court. When PTI MPAs raise genuine issues the ruling party members attack them in order to suppress their voice, lamented Haleem. ""In the last sitting our member raised the issue of dogs rule in Sindh, but members from other side attacked them. I still believe that there is dogs rule because stray dogs are moving freely biting people in the province, which lacks anti-rabies vaccination,"" he said, adding that the PPP-led Sindh government has victimised him by lodging fake cases against him. Responding to the opposition leader, PPP MPA Sharjeel Inam Memon said that no fake case was registered and he can prove that Haleem was roaming in the Malir's PS-88 with guns during the by-polls. Showing video clips and photos purportedly of Haleem and his guards, who were carrying firearms, Memon declared that he would resign if anyone proved this wrong.

Foreign policy lessons from ZAB,2021-03-02,Tribune,"With the new United States administration coming into power, many foreign policy experts have started to lay out various scenarios of AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s new South Asian policy as President Biden bids to reverse much of TrumpÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s foreign policy adventurism and revive the very stalled international liberal order once again. At home, with the PTI government steering PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s foreign policy trembling wheel since 2018, little has been achieved but more has been lost at international forums. To name a few, in 2019, our Kashmiri narrative became less convincing as IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s draconian military lockdown in the Illegally Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) remains till today and the international community is mostly taciturn. Recently, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, in a Senate session on foreign policy, questioned what the opposition has done about the Kashmiri cause instead of highlighting the incumbent governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s track record, which matters in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s strategic political scenario. Second, the PM, at the eleventh hour, backed out from the historic Kuala Lumpur Summit. This was seen as a major foreign policy blow for the country. Third, despite bulldozing the FATF bills in the parliament without even consulting the opposition, Pakistan still remains in the task forceÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s grey list with uncertainty looming large as IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s malicious attempts to undermine Pakistan at global forums remain manifest. Instead of promoting a soft image inside the country, many national security analysts now argue that Pakistan might become a police state with relentless powers given to law enforcement authorities without any checks and balances. Most importantly, Pakistan, as the only Muslim nuclear-armed country in the world, has lost its leadership role in the Muslim world which was once our pride back in the day. With all of this, what really is the urgent need of the hour is looking back at the real foundations of PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s foreign policy, which were set by Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. Not only did we have a robust and resilient leadership role in the Muslim world but we also stood firm with our stance among the major powers in times of crisis.Today, illiberal values and undemocratic practices are rampant in the country with political victimisation of political opponents, relentless media censorship, persecution of minorities and demoralising of the parliamentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s spirit. Bhutto was a firm advocate of the notion that foreign policy begins at home. Despite the Fall of Dhaka in 1971 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” which was indeed a dark chapter in the history of Pakistan ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” Bhutto strived for civilian supremacy and the revival of the Constitution of Pakistan. It was he who gave us the 1973 Constitution and restored democracy when authoritarianism was looming large in the country. He advocated forming a ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â˜perfect unionÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ where all provinces were on the same page, regardless of political differences. The ConstitutionÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Article 153 gave us the Council of Common Interests (CCI), where the PM sits down with the chief ministers of all provinces every 90 days to discuss matters for the greater good of the country. Bhutto understood that for a constructive and sound foreign policy narrative in a fast-changing world, internal domestic stability was crucial. Despite intense political pressure from the US and other major powers to halt PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s nuclear programme, Bhutto remained resilient. He argued: ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœIf India makes an atomic bomb, then we will also do so, even if we have to eat grass, an atom bomb can only be answered by an atom bomb.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â The US went to great lengths to halt PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s nuclear weapons programme, but Bhutto was clearly not having it. In his 1969 book, The Myth of Independence, he wrote that it was ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœvital for Pakistan to give the greatest possible attention to nuclear technology, rather than allow itself to be deceived by an international treaty limiting this deterrent to the present nuclear powersÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â.Today, when Yemen is on fire, instability looms large in the Middle East, and where the Kashmir issue at the backburner, we need a charismatic leader like Bhutto to unite the Muslim world, and one who had also played a pioneering role in the creation of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). We need someone like Bhutto who understood the complexity of the fast-changing international political arena and steered the wheel of PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s foreign policy with unparallel command, especially in the Muslim world. In his book, The Third World, The Imperative of Unity, Bhutto clearly argued that the Muslim world must unite as a galvanising force in order to survive in the international political arena. Without a doubt, Bhutto pulled the country back from imminent anarchy and collapse and infused more dynamism into Pakistani society. Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger in his memoir, Years of Upheaval, described Bhutto as a man of extraordinary abilities, capable of drawing close to any country that served PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s national interests. His foreign policy anchored resilience, promoted multilateralism, had a commanding seat at every global forum and ensured Pakistan came first ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” something which is clearly an urgent need in todayÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s time.

internal domestic stability was crucial. despite intense political pressure from the US and other major powers to halt pakistans nuclear programme, bhutto remained resilient. he argued if india makes an atomic bomb, then we will also do so, even if we have to eat grass, an atom bomb can only be answered by an atom bomb. the US went to great lengths to halt pakistans nuclear weapons programme, but bhutto was clearly not having it. in his 1969 book, the myth of independence, he wrote that it was vital for pakistan to give the greatest possible attention to nuclear technology, rather than allow itself to be deceived by an international treaty limiting this deterrent to the present nuclear powers.today, when yemen is on fire, instability looms large in the middle east, and where the kashmir issue at the backburner, we need a charismatic leader like bhutto to unite the muslim world, and one who had also played a pioneering role in the creation of the organisation of islamic cooperation (OIC). we need someone like bhutto who understood the complexity of the fast-changing international political arena and steered the wheel of pakistans foreign policy with unparallel command, especially in the muslim world. in his book, the third world, the imperative of unity, bhutto clearly argued that the muslim world must unite as a galvanising force in order to survive in the international political arena. without a doubt, bhutto pulled the country back from imminent anarchy and collapse and infused more dynamism into pakistani society. former US secretary of state henry kissinger in his memoir, years of upheaval, described bhutto as a man of extraordinary abilities, capable of drawing close to any country that served pakistans national interests. his foreign policy anchored resilience, promoted multilateralism, had a commanding seat at every global forum and ensured pakistan came first something which is clearly an urgent need in todays time.

FATF: looking into the crystal ball,2021-03-02,Tribune,"On February 22, as Pakistani officials joined the FATFÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s virtual plenary session, they probably knew in their hearts that Pakistan was still away from an exit from the grey list, yet they took comfort in knowing that Pakistan has successfully dodged the threat of blacklisting, which could have been catastrophic for the country. Only a few months ago, the concluding statement of the FATFÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s October plenary session had already indicated a change of heart in the global watchdog, as it confirmed that Pakistan had successfully completed 21 out of 27 actions. It was the first time since PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s blacklisting in 2018 that the official FATF statement did not carry an ultimatum. The run-up to the February 2021 meeting therefore had not been as tense as before. If anything, the country has gone ahead and not backwards. And they were proved right, as FATF acknowledged the completion of another three actions.It is a fact that Pakistan has shown remarkable progress on the FATF action plan in the last 18 months and is now very close to the finish line.But there are three remaining actions that need to be addressed and if looked at closely, these very actions form the crux of the terrorism financing (TF) challenge. These include demonstrating that TF investigations and prosecutions are targeting designated persons and entities and those acting on their behalf, leading in turn to effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions. The country also needs to demonstrate effective implementation of sanctions against assets of designated persons and entities in accordance with UNSC Resolutions 1267 and 1373.Even on these three unaddressed areas, Pakistan has made some headway. Law enforcement agencies have intensified their operations against banned outfits such as Jamaat-ud-Dawa, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation and the prominent JuD leader Hafiz Saeed, who was already serving two sentences of five years each, was convicted in two other TF cases, after the last FATF meeting, carrying a five- and 10-year sentence. But apparently this was not deemed enough by FATF and Pakistan has been asked to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœdo moreÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â.If Pakistan does not take the foot off the pedal, it is likely to get approval for an on-site visit in June, which could pave the way for the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s removal from the grey list in October.But getting out of the grey list doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t end this journey for Pakistan. The regular evaluation process for PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s AML/CFT (Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism) regime is on the horizon already. FATF recently updated its consolidated assessment ratings for different countries, assessing them against 11 immediate outcomes for effectiveness and 40 recommendations for technical compliance. PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s rating is based on the Mutual Evaluation Report from October 2019 and the Follow-up Report from September 2020. Till date, Pakistan has low effectiveness on 10 out of 11 immediate outcomes, whereas against the 40 recommendations, Pakistan is non-compliant on four, partially compliant on 25, largely compliant on nine and fully compliant on two. Although some of these deficiencies would have already been addressed through the FATF action plan such as through improved regulation of Designated Non-Financial Business and Professions (DNFBP) and trusts or legislation for mutual legal assistance, there are many areas that the country would still need to improve on. Pakistan will now have to deal with both the FATF action plan as well as the other evaluation process. Although theoretically FATF could merge the two processes, it would be in PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s interest to keep them separate and claim victory on the grey-list exit first and then deal with the other process. Nevertheless, the whole process can very well spill into the next year. A successful conclusion of both these processes would require continued momentum on ground and persistent behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts to muster up support.

The hosiery giant is expanding its hosiery business further and is also diversifying into other related apparel segments such as denim, knitwear and active wear. In 2018 it set seamless active wear manufacturing unit at Interloop Industrial Park, Faisalabad. It also established IL Apparel (Pvt.) Limited; a subsidiary of Interloop Limited, for manufacturing knitwear apparel, which is planned for a complete vertical setup by 2021. Recent PerformanceTextile sector - though the largest export segment - has been struggling over the years with many challenges including value addition, keeping up the export orders, shortage of gas, lack of timely sales tax refunds etc. In addition, macroeconomic indicators at home and rising global competition primarily from China, India, Bangladesh, and Cambodia has been taking away much of the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s share in total textile exports. Overall, FY19 was a challenging year for Pakistan characterized by consolidation measures and economic contraction. However, 2019 was a happening year for Interloop. Besides increasing its hosiery capacity further, the company was listed on the stock exchange, which was the largest private sector IPO in the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s history. It further expanded into apparel with the establishment of Interloop Denim apparel manufacturing plant at Lahore that commenced operation in December 2019.  ILP had a historical 5-year CAGR of around 9 percent and 17 percent for revenue and earnings, respectively till FY19. The companyÃ¢Â€Â™s revenues grew by 20 percent year-on-year in FY19, while its earnings jumped up by 34 percent year-on-year. Besides the investments paying off, a key factor for growth in topline was the favorable exchange rate regime.  Overall, where profit margin of the company increased due to its cost management and devaluation of the currency, its asset base improved on account of continuous expansion of production facilities and balancing, modernizing and replacement of existing manufacturing facilities and other routine capex investments. As far as financial leverage is concerned, it dropped due to the increase in equity base over the period due to equity injection. FY20 was a weaker year for Interloop in terms of profitability and sales as COVID-19 struck and the ensuing restrictions affected operations.

Likewise, exports of bed wear increased by 16.38 percent while the exports of towels increased by 17.47 percent. As such, one sector that has come out successful from the pandemic-hit year has been the textile sector in the country primarily because of resumption of backlogged export orders as well as rising new export orders, especially in the value-added textiles. Where FY20 bogged was down declining exports and profits for the textile sector hopes for FY21 have been pinned to a V-shaped recovery in the sector.  The textile giant has been focusing on investment in all segments especially denim, and knitwear.

Around 90 percent year-on-year growth in 1HFY21 earnings for ILP came from the top where revenues were seen climbing by 37 percent year-on-year. The growth in revenues came from full capacity utilization post revival of the economic activity that brought with itself stockpiled orders as well as order diversion from countries that continued to remain closed or under restrictions due to Covid-19. Not only has ILPÃ¢Â€Â™s hosiery division been operating at 100 percent capacity with no more order-booking till JuneÃ¢Â€Â™21 as well as continuous addition of new machineries; but the denim plant also reached close to 100 percent capacity utilization by the end 1QFY21.

Ensuring durability of the peace process,2021-03-03,Tribune,"The broader objective for the partition of the Sub-continent was that the people of India and Pakistan would live in peace and harmony and establish their countries on the basis of their separate identities, religious ethos and democratic values. Unfortunately, the exact opposite has been their history, for ever since independence they have been engaged in perpetual hostility, fought two major wars and experienced several serious military encounters. Whereas the territorial and ideological dispute of Kashmir which remains central to this lingering hostility remains unresolved, like an open wound, bleeding and causing untold pain and suffering to its people. The worst affected are, of course, the people of the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK). But the fallout has also seriously impacted both countries with Pakistan taking the maximum brunt. So, the question is: when will India, the intransigent party to the Kashmir conflict, change its attitude and be willing to find a peaceful and honourable solution to this intractable dispute?The question arises as to how one should interpret the latest development in which Pakistan and India have recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire arrangement at the Line of Control (LoC) and agreed to address the core issues that could undermine peace and stability. Because of past history there is considerable scepticism regarding the latest ceasefire agreement and the possibility of the two countries turning a new chapter in the relationship. Pakistan has all along been a proponent of political engagement and it is only IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s unilateral freezing of all communication that had shut the door. It seems very possible that the trying economic conditions in India were a major factor that has prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lower the animus against Pakistan. Moreover, pursuing the Hindu nationalist agenda in a country where diversity would flourish was destined to fail. The spread of the pandemic, the governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s mismanagement of the economy and the Sikh communityÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s mass protests reflect that the people in India are greatly disillusioned. These happenings have pushed the BJP government on the back foot, its reputation has been seriously impaired and the myth of shining India has exploded. The real test of IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s sincerity in pursuing the peace agenda with Pakistan would be gauged by how it abandons its inhumane policy in Kashmir and as a first step, reverts back to the August 2019 position. There are many who argue, and for good reason, that even if the Kashmir dispute is somehow resolved, the animosity and confrontational policies would not cease. And the time for an honourable settlement, if there was any, has long gone past. Tragically, the perpetuation of the conflict has acquired a certain pattern of external and internal dynamics that has the support of influential groups in both countries and is backed by major powers. Moreover, it would be an unrealistic expectation that the current peace gestures would lead to any change in KashmirÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s territorial status. Countering the forces that undermine the peace process would be a common challenge of the two countries.  The global strategic environment that earlier was dominated by the United States to counter the former Soviet Union is presently pitched against China. Inferring from this it is not surprising that the US-China rivalry is already casting its shadow on India-Pakistan relations making the Kashmir dispute even more intractable. These undercurrents where major powers side with one group or the other are generally present in most of the major chronic regional conflicts as is evident in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, undermining the very integrity of these states.The new Biden administration has come with a new resolve and definitive plans to counter ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s emerging global rise and expects India, Japan, South Korea and Western powers to actively thwart its ambitions. Unfortunately, this is a replication of the Cold War strategy, but this is how the US plans to perpetuate its position as a global hegemon. China seems prepared to face this challenge and is exuding confidence by strengthening its economy and expanding its influence globally. It is focusing on catching up with the US and the West in space and cutting-edge technologies. The recent successful mission of its highly sophisticated Tianwen-1 spacecraft in the Martian orbit was a demonstration of this national resolve. It is taking a lead in developing technologies to counter the delirious effects of climate change that unfortunately the Trump administration was deliberately giving a low priority to. India too has made exceptional progress in space endeavours. The Mars Orbiter Mission is a space probe orbiting Mars since 2014 and the first Asian nation to reach the Martian orbit. Washington would particularly like India not to fritter away its national power on Pakistan and focus more on China. In all likelihood, it is nudging the two neighbours to engage in dialogue and resolve their differences peacefully. Currently, the gap between China and IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economic, political and strategic power is too wide and the hostility with Pakistan is increasing it even further. Moreover, unending Indian antagonism leaves Pakistan with no other option but to get closer to China. In this scenario, how would Beijing respond to a durable Pakistan-India deÃƒÂŒÃ‚Âtente? There is a school of thought that it suits Beijing that India remains embroiled with Pakistan and its internal uprisings so that it is not in a position to counter its global ambitions.India has been operating in Afghanistan and patronising elements in the Afghan army and the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan and other groups that are inimical toward Pakistan. Hopefully, this would end soon. It is expected that the easing of Pakistan-India tensions would contribute to facilitating the Afghan peace process and reduce incidents of violence on the Pak-Afghan border. Despite the unfavourable international environment and serious misgivings due to a gloomy past, the hope is that the leadership of India and Pakistan will take a hard look at the plight of its people and prioritise their wellbeing and harmonise state policies accordingly. Moreover, why should South Asia remain burdened with its inherited legacy while many former colonies have come out of it?","ensuring durability of the peace process the broader objective for the

Exporters threaten protest over yarn shortage,2021-03-03,Tribune,"KARACHI:Textile exporters have threatened that they will stage a nationwide protest if the government failed to arrange cotton yarn, which is direly needed to meet pending export orders.They voiced fear that the shortage of raw material would prompt overseas buyers to cancel the export orders given to Pakistani enterprises and approach their regional counterparts.At a press conference on Tuesday, Council of Textile Associations Chairman Zubair Motiwala said that the value-added textile sector had been calling on the government for the past five months to deal with the shortage of cotton yarn, but no action was taken.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe inconsiderate response is tantamount to lack of priority and non-seriousness towards value-added textile exports,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThis segment contributes around 62% to total exports, provides 42% of urban employment, particularly to the female workforce, earns the highest foreign exchange and supports approximately 40 allied industries.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂHe warned the government of dire consequences if the raw material deficit persisted and appealed to the authorities to permit duty-free import of cotton yarn besides imposing a ban on its export to save the export-oriented industries and employment.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœIt is governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s responsibility to decide whether it wants to enhance exports or trigger large-scale shutdown of export industries,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â remarked Motiwala.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœA few months ago, the government approved dutyfree import of wheat and sugar in view of the shortage of the two commodities but it is ignoring the looming cotton yarn crisis, which is deplorable,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said.Motiwala pointed out that the scarcity of cotton yarn would translate into a decline in value-added textile exports. Highlighting that the drop in cotton crop yield was a major factor behind the yarn shortage, he said that the demand for cotton yarn had risen because the exporters had worked hard to win a large number of export orders.He said Pakistan was able to achieve a significant jump in textile exports over the past six months because the businessmen had got a large number of orders from different countries.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWhenever the value-added textile sector realises its full potential, an anti-export move emerges and all efforts of the businessmen go in vain,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he remarked.Previously, the disconnection of gas supply to the captive power plants of export-oriented industries damaged the image of PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s exporters in the eyes of foreign buyers, he pointed out.

Kashmir at a tipping point,2021-03-03,Tribune,"As Pakistan observed the Kashmir Solidarity Day last month, Kashmiris in the Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) continue living in unprecedented and appalling conditions. While Kashmiris in the IOK have been a target of barbaric human rights abuses for decades, the revocation of articles 370 and 35(A) in August 2019, by the Hindu fundamentalist BJP party has put the existence of the Kashmiri nation into jeopardy.The Kashmiris have been in the worst form of lockdown since August 2019, as they are completely cut off from the rest of the world and are deprived of even basic freedoms such as communicating with their beloved ones outside Kashmir. This, coupled with the ongoing human rights abuses in the Kashmir Valley, is having a detrimental physical and psychological effect on Kashmiris. The physical human rights abuses are often mentioned, but it is imperative to emphasise the negative psychological effect the current turmoil is having on the Kashmiris. If Kashmiris, especially children who possess a fragile mind, are under constant pressure, fear and anxiety, it can severely damage them psychologically. It is ironic that while in most countries there are strict laws to not display any kind of violence in children movies or cartoons, the Kashmiri children witness violence in their everyday lives.The abrogation of the Article 35(A) has consequently given rights to Indians to buy property in IOK, which could lead to demographic changes in the region. The Hindu extremist BJP, backed by RSS, has exuded emphatically in the past and present its anti-Muslim stance ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ be it the demolition of the historic Babri Masjid, massacre of Muslims in the 2002 Gujarat riots, or the more recent anti-Muslim violence in Delhi. In addition, the passing of the discriminatory Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019 was the first time that religion had been overtly used as a condition for citizenship in Indian law. Not only has this nullified IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s prolonged claim that the ideological basis for the creation of India was secularism, it can be perilous for the future of Kashmiri Muslims who are in a majority in IOK at the moment.While Urdu had been the official language of IOK for over a hundred years, last year the Indian Union government passed the bill to introduce Hindi and Dogri as official languages too. It is evident in South Asian history that Urdu has always been seen as the ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â˜language of the MuslimsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™, especially as many religious scriptures were written in Urdu. The attempt by the government to erode away Urdu in IOK is undermining Islam in the region. Moreover, there have been attacks on the culture of the Kashmiris as well, such as the ban of the traditional Kashmiri attire, pheran. Destroying a nationÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s culture is like killing a nation without a bullet because culture is the identity of a nation.While the present situation in IOK is deplorable for Kashmiris, there are still some factors which could be instrumental in ameliorating the condition of the Kashmiris, who have been under long-standing Indian tyranny. Firstly, India has been recently engaged in a border dispute with China, where the troops of both countries have had aggressive face-offs and skirmishes along the Sino-Indian border as well as clashes along eastern Ladakh along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Moreover, India is currently facing internal unrest as tens of thousands of farmers are protesting in New Delhi. This could be why India possibly caved into pressure by Pakistan and the international community to sit on the negotiating table to discuss the Kashmir issue. In the present situation, rationally, India would not want to fight from both of its borders ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” the LAC and the LoC ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” while controlling the internal unrest at the same time. It is preposterous that at one end while India aims to make advancements like reaching the moon, on the other end it has refused to even sit on the negotiating table with Pakistan to discuss the intractable Kashmir issue for so long, putting the lives of millions of Kashmiris on stake.For Pakistan, the present time brings some optimism in resolving the Kashmir dispute politically. PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Prime Minister Imran Khan has got a dynamic personality, which has earned him immense global reputation. In 2019, he was named one of Time MagazineÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s 100 Most Influential People in the World and in 2020, he was recognised as the 16th most influential Muslim in the world in ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe 500 Most Influential MuslimsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â list. In addition to being dedicated to the Kashmir cause, a leader needs to be influential and renowned internationally if (s)he is to make a significant contribution to resolving the Kashmir dispute, especially given IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s longstanding rigid and absurd stance of not engaging in a dialogue with Pakistan. It would definitely not be easy for Imran Khan given the inherent complications of this longstanding conflict, but in the present time, he is the only leader in Pakistan who possesses the potential to bring a substantial positive change for the Kashmiris in IOK. In addition, the current PTI government has had cordial relations with the military, which favours the Kashmir cause. A strong nexus between the civil and military leadership of Pakistan is imperative if Pakistan is to accomplish anything for the Kashmiris.To the dismay of Kashmiris, they did not get enough international support after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019. However, now there seems to be some international support, especially with UK MPs debating the situation in Kashmir in the House of Commons and several MPs agreeing to the brutal treatment of Kashmiris in IOK, in January. British MP Debbie Abrahams also wrote a letter to UK Premier Boris Johnson to take a note of the grave human rights abuses in IOK. This should be seen as a ray of hope for Kashmiris as the world is aware of their miseries even though India has callously cut them off from the rest of the world. The debate in the British parliament could potentially lead to more debates and discussions about the situation of Kashmir in various other countries too.The year 2021 could be a life-changing year for Kashmiris as they are currently living in a vale of tears and the current Hindu nationalist BJP government poses a dire threat to the Kashmiri identity. On the positive side, Pakistan and the international community can take advantage of IndiaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s current unstable position to pressurise it to negotiate the Kashmir Issue. Pakistan should come up with a defined and clear strategy pertaining to the dispute. A more robust, organised and aggressive international lobbying by Pakistan could be a good starting point.

PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s trade deficit widens 24%,2021-03-04,Tribune,"ISLAMABAD:PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s exports have plunged for the successive second month to slightly over $2 billion in February, proving once again that a recent peak in exports was the result of some external factors and policy measures, including 30% currency devaluation, did not help.Contrary to over 4% contraction in exports, the imports increased one-tenth to $4.6 billion last month on an annualised basis, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported on Wednesday. Resultantly, PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s trade deficit widened nearly 24% in February 2021 on a year-on-year basis.The gap between imports and exports increased to $2.5 billion in February over a year ago, a jump of $486 million or 24%, the PBS said.It was the second consecutive month that PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s exports dropped from their previous levels. The $2.04 billion worth of export receipts were the lowest in five months. The exports had started picking up early this fiscal year and peaked to $2.4 billion in December, prompting celebrations on twitter - the micro blogging website - by the government.But this proved to be a short-term achievement, as the exports again started sliding towards historical band of around $2 billion. PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s exports have long remained around $2 billion a month and the trend did not significantly change despite 30% currency depreciation during the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s tenure in the past two and a half years. During the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) tenure, the exports had peaked to $2.3 billion and then again settled below $2 billion.Every successive government has doled out billions of rupees in subsidies to the exporters every year on account of cheap loans, electricity and gas. The exporters also pay a nominal tax on their incomes. Yet, they have failed and the government does not seem ready to review its flawed strategy of pampering few hundred exporters.The exporters had attributed increase in exports during previous months to shifting of global trade from China towards South Asian countries and replenishing the dried inventories by the buyers in the US and Europe after the global economy gradually started recovering from the effects of Covid-19.On a month-on-month basis, the exports decreased over 4.5% to $2.04 billion, according to the PBS. There was a reduction of $97 million in export receipts in February as compared to the preceding month. The imports also registered a decline of 5.2% and stood at $4.6 billion last month. In absolute terms, there was a reduction of $254 million in the import bill last month. As a result, the trade deficit contracted 5.9% or $157 million in February over January.During the July-February period of this fiscal year, exports increased 4.3% and stood at $16.3 billion as compared to $15.6 billion in the same period of last year, according to the national data collecting agency. In absolute terms, there was an increase of $671 million in exports during the first eight months of current fiscal year.However, these growth figures are disputed, as the State Bank of PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s data for the first seven months showed 3.8% contraction in exports. Instead of rectifying things, the Ministry of Commerce has been claiming huge success on the exports front through social media campaign.Imports during the July-February period increased 7.5% or $2.4 billion to $33.8 billion. As a result, the balance of trade recorded an increase of 10.6% to $17.5 billion, stated the PBS.The government has already missed the annual export target in its first two years. For the current fiscal year, it has set the export target at $22.7 billion, which will require 6.2% growth. This seems an uphill task now; given the fact that the little growth in exports has been disputed by the central bank.

Rupee hits highest level against dollar in FY21,2021-03-04,Dawn,"KARACHI: The 73-paisa gain on Wednesday tossed the rupee to its highest level during the current fiscal year against the US dollar at Rs157.12 in the interbank market.The local currency has so far recovered 6.8 per cent in 2020-21 against the greenback on the back of higher inflows and slow demand for US dollars. The rupee closed at Rs157.12 in interbank market from Rs157.85 on  Tuesday.  The dollar price recorded a fall of Rs2.97, or 1.8pc, during  the last 30 days.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Not sure how far the dollar will continue to fall but some macro indicators are in support of local currency,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ said Atif Ahmd, a currency dealer in the interbank market. Currency dealers said the demand for dollars was low while the inflows into the banking system have increased significantly which strengthened the rupee.The exchange rate uncertainty has been a persistent problem for trade and industry particularly exporters and importers.  However, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) now maintains and is market-based.The SBP governor said a number of times that the central bank has succeeded in bringing stability in the exchange rate due to market-based mechanism.Since the beginning of FY21, the exchange rate came under immense pressure as the dollar rate touched an all-time high of Rs168.8 on Aug 15, 2020. However, the dollar rate started easing from September 2020 and had gradually been losing its value against the rupee since then. The Covid-19 related slowdown did have its impact on the economy, but  exporters had succeeded to grab more orders compared to the preceding  fiscal year which improved the overall inflow with high export proceeds  during ongoing fiscal year.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½We could not expect that inflows through the Roshan Digital Account (RDA) would pick pace so quickly as they already have crossed over $600 million within a few months of its launch. The amount is not big but the signs are positive for higher inflows in coming months and years,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ rechange in the inflow of foreign investment in the domestic bonds (Pakistan Investment Bonds) from November 2020 and the PIBs attracted $137 million so far. Other important factor is inflow of remittances which remained above $2bn each month during the current fiscal year.Forex Association of Pakistan President Malik Bostan told Dawn the inflows through exchange companies were also higher than last year. He expected that the exchange companies would deposit up to $3bn into banks through export proceeds (against selling of currencies other than US dollar in Dubai) by June 30. Last year this amount was $2.5bn.The currency dealers in both the interbank and open markets were keenly watching the current account which is still in surplus during the first seven months of FY21 at $912m. However, the current account became negative by $229m in January, a sharp contraction from $652m deficit in December 2020. Experts see no big improvement in exports in the remaining months of  this fiscal year that could have negative impact on exchange rate as  well as export proceeds and ultimately the current account could be in  deficit by the end of FY21.Published in Dawn, March 4th, 2021","rupee hits highest level against dollar in FY21 KARACHI the 73-paisa gain on wednesday tossed the rupee to its highest level during the current fiscal year against the US dollar at rs 157.12 in the interbank market.the local currency has so far recovered 6.8 per cent in 2020-21 against the greenback on the back of higher inflows and slow demand for US dollars. the rupee closed at rs 157.12 in interbank market from rs 157.85 on tuesday. the dollar price recorded a fall of rs 2.97, or 1.8pc, during the last 30 days.not sure how far the dollar will continue to fall but some macro indicators are in support of local currency, said atif ahmd, a currency dealer in the interbank market. currency dealers said the demand for dollars was low while the inflows into the banking system have increased significantly which strengthened the rupee.the exchange rate uncertainty has been a persistent problem for trade and industry particularly exporters and importers. however, the state bank of pakistan (SBP) now maintains and is market-based.The SBP governor said a number of times that the central bank has succeeded in bringing stability in the exchange rate due to market-based mechanism.since the beginning of FY21, the exchange rate came under immense pressure as the dollar rate touched an all-time high of rs 168.8 on aug 15, 2020. however, the dollar rate started easing from september 2020 and had gradually been losing its value against the rupee since then. the Covid-19 related slowdown did have its impact on the economy, but exporters had succeeded to grab more orders compared to the preceding fiscal year which improved the overall inflow with high export proceeds during ongoing fiscal year.we could not expect that inflows through the roshan digital account (RDA) would pick pace so quickly as they already have crossed over $600 million within a few months of its launch. the amount is not big but the signs are positive for higher inflows in coming months and years, rechange in the inflow of foreign investment in the domestic bonds (Pakistan investment bonds) from november 2020 and the PIBs attracted $137 million so far. other important factor is inflow of remittances which remained above $2bn each month during the current fiscal year.forex association of pakistan president malik bostan told dawn the inflows through exchange companies were also higher than last year. he expected that the exchange companies would deposit up to $3bn into banks through export proceeds (against selling of currencies other than US dollar in dubai) by june 30. last year this amount was $2.5bn.the currency dealers in both the interbank and open markets were keenly watching the current account which is still in surplus during the first seven months of FY21 at $912m. however, the current account became negative by $229m in january, a sharp contraction from $652m deficit in december 2020. experts see no big improvement in exports in the remaining months of this fiscal year that could have negative impact on exchange rate as well as export proceeds and ultimately the current account could be in deficit by the end of FY21."
ECP protected those who made money by holding Senate elections through secret ballot: PM Imran,2021-03-04,Dawn,"Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday lashed out at the opposition Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) for ""making a mockery of democracy"", while also calling out the ECP for ""protecting those who made money by holding the Senate elections through secret ballot"".The premier made these remarks in an address to the nation where he explained the political situation in the country that emerged after Wednesday's Senate elections in which the opposition managed to stage an upset.""It is important to talk about it and explain it, because the problems in our country can be understood through the kind of election that happened,"" the premier said at the start of his address.  He said when the PTI took part in the Senate elections six years ago, he realised that ""money is used"" in the polls for the upper house. This was not a new phenomenon, he said, but had been going on for the last 30-40 years.""The one who becomes a senator and wants to become one uses money and who do they buy? Members of parliament.""So I was surprised when I came to know and since then I started a campaign that what joke is happening with our democracy? What kind of democracy is this?"" he said, noting that the country's leadership emerged from the Senate elections and the parliament, and the prime minister and cabinet members were chosen from among lawmakers.""So I was surprised that when you're spending money, a senator becomes a senator by giving bribes, and on the other side [are] those MPs who are selling their conscience and voting after taking money, then what kind of democracy is this? Since then I started my campaign and I said since then that there should be open ballot.""In the 2018 Senate elections, Imran said he came to know that 20 PTI lawmakers had sold their votes after taking money. ""We expelled the 20 members but then I saw that it wasn't just me saying this, but the two main parties that signed the Charter of Democracy Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ the PML-N and PPP Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ had agreed that there should be open ballot bec"" he added, saying PML-N leaders later also issued similar statements. In view of the above, the premier said, the PTI presented a bill in the parliament seeking open ballot for the Senate polls. ""Then we saw it wasn't happening and the parties which had said that there should be open ballot didn't support us. We then went to the Supreme Court and a whole case was heard in the SC. [During the hearings,] judges repeatedly asked about money being exchanged, and during that a video came out of MPs taking money ahead of the 2018 Senate elections, so no one had any doubt,"" he said.He noted that while the matter was being heard in the apex court, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) opposed open ballot, while the SC repeatedly said that it was the ECP's responsibility to conduct honest and transparent elections.""All the parties of the PDM then united and said together that there should be secret ballot when they all said in the past that there should be open ballot.""Now I ask all of you, what in your opinion was the reason [for their stance]?"" Prime Minister Imran asked the nation. ""These parties wanted an open ballot before, then why did they all now push for secret ballot?""He said the opposition had termed open ballot against the Constitution and democracy but asked: ""Was it not against the Constitution when they signed the Charter of Democracy? They had placed a bill in the Senate and said at that time that there should be open ballot.""He further said the opposition had planned to ""use money"" in the election contest between Yousuf Raza Gilani and Abdul Hafeez Shaikh. ""Full effort was to be done to break our members and align them with [the opposition] by giving them money. And if somehow Hafeez Shaikh were to lose that election, what would that prove? That Imran Khan's majority in the parliament has finished,"" he added, saying in such a scenario, the opposition's next step would be to bring a vote of no confidence. ""So the real objective was to hang the sword of vote of confidence over me and blackmail me into somehow giving them NRO.""The prime minister said if the Senate elections had taken place through open ballot, the PTI ""would have gotten as many seats as it has currently won. [The opposition] are behaving as if they have won some major battle, but we got the same seats; we are the biggest party in the Senate.""He said the opposition had done all the ""drama"" for the Islamabad seat, while Gilani was ""distributing money and buying people's consciences"". The premier revealed that some female members of the PTI had been offered millions of rupees in exchange for their votes by some old PTI worker. Imran then addressed the ECP and said: ""You have a big role, your biggest responsibility is [holding] honest and transparent elections.""First I didn't understand why you went to court and said there should be secret ballot. Tell me does any constitution give the permission for stealing or giving bribes, which is what has happened for 30 years?""He noted that the SC also gave an opportunity to the ECP to conduct the elections through secret ballot but have the ballot be identifiable. In such a mode, the premier said, the PTI would be able to identify its members ""who were sold"".

View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Churail Sarwat (@sarwatg) Prime Minister Imran wondered what example was being set for the young population of Pakistan through the corrupt practices, citing leaked videos of alleged horse-trading being taken place ahead of the Senate polls. He asked the ECP whether it had made any efforts after a 2018 video emerged showing lawmakers ""putting money in bags"", saying: ""Did you not know that it was your responsibility to investigate? [You have] all the agencies under you, this spectacle unfolded in front of everyone.""The premier said he had warned in advance that rates were being set for lawmakers and the ECP was aware it would happen. ""When you were given the opportunity by the SC then what was the reason that you couldn't do barcoding on 1,500 ballots?"" he asked the commission. ""You gave a complete opportunity to discredit the country's democracy [and] damaged the country's morality and values.""He stressed that corruption was eliminated from a society when a nation worked together for it. ""I ask all of my nation that if you accept these dacoits, is it Imran Khan's responsibility alone to go after them? This is all of your's responsibility,"" he said, referring to opposition members.He further told the people: ""This is on you, do you want to take your country up or do you want to compromise with these thieves?

I live in my own home, the only expense of the government on me is of travel and security.""There will be no difference in my life if I'm not in power, but I have a message for all of you, whether I sit in opposition or am even outside of the assembly, I will not leave anyone of you until you return this country's money.""Imran said if he was outside the parliament, he would ""bring out this nation's people"", who he said will join him on the street to protect the country's stolen money. ""I will show you how to bring the public out, it makes no difference to my life.""As long as I'm alive, for the supremacy of law in this country, I will keep challenging these people, whom I call traitors, who take money abroad after stealing. [...] I believe this country will become a great country and it will become so when all these dacoits are in jail.""Pakistan's 'downfall'Prime Minister Imran said ever since his government was formed, ""all these corrupt people in the old political parties"" feared that he would move forward on the corruption cases against them since he had run his election campaign on the agenda to eliminate corruption.""I want to remind you that their corruption cases are old, we didn't make them, they are since their times, in our time only five per cent cases [have been started], while the rest are all old,"" he said, adding that the opposition had since then united to put pressure on the government. ""All of them have one interest: to exert so much pressure on me that I raise my hands and, like Gen Musharraf, give them an NRO and end their corruption cases.""He said the opposition first tried to blackmail him over the 2018 elections, then during the coronavirus crisis and later on legislation related to the requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Noting that Pakistan could be placed on the FATF's 'blacklist' if it didn't meet its requirements, the premier said the opposition had sought a virtual elimination of the National Accountability Bureau in exchange for supporting the bill. Recounting his journey into politics, Prime Minister Imran said 50 years ago Pakistan's example was given and it a status in the world. ""But I slowly saw our country going down, and the destruction after 1985 in this country, ever since corruption went sky-high [and] there was a non-party based election.""Before that when I came from India to Pakistan after playing cricket it felt like coming from a poor country to a rich country but slowly we began to see that change,"" he added.

ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThey spared no effort to break away our lawmakers and offered them money. Their plan was to defeat Hafeez Shaikh to prove that Imran Khan has lost majority in parliament,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he addedImran held the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) responsible for damaging countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s democracy by failing to hold fair and transparent Senate election. He said he would take a vote of confidence from the National Assembly on Saturday (tomorrow) and was ready to sit on the opposition benches than giving amnesty to the opposition.Accusing the national poll supervisor of allegedly protecting those who made money by holding Senate elections through secret ballot, the prime minister said that the ECPÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s failure to hold fair and transparent elections has damaged the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s morality and democracy.The premier said that corruption took place right under the ECPÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s nose and what happened in the Senate elections was a reflection of all the problems of the country.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWhat was the reason that you [ECP] couldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t print 1,500 ballot papers with bar code,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â Imran questioned. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœYou [ECP] gave a complete chance to discredit countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s democracyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â and democracy was undermined by secret ballot, he said. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœConducting fair and transparent elections is the constitutional responsibility of the election commission.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂSimultaneously, the premier threw down the gauntlet to the treasury benchesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ lawmakers to openly vote against him if they felt he was ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœincompetentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â during the assembly session summoned by the President Dr Arif Alvi at 12:15pm on March 6.Also read: PDM's Yousaf Raza Gilani defeats PTI's Hafeez Shaikh in major upset in Senate electionsThe prime minister expressed his willingness to sit on the opposition benches rather than giving an NRO to ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœcorruptÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â politicians belonging to PDM ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ a reference to the political amnesty given by former military ruler Pervez Musharraf through the National Reconciliation Ordinance in 2007.Referring to ShaikhÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s defeat and explaining why he opted for taking a vote of confidence from the National Assembly, Imran said the ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœopposition wanted to take NRO by brandishing the sword of no-confidence but I donÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t want power; I prefer the future of the country over itÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â.The premier directly accused Gilani of buying PTI lawmakers and criticised him for choosing to stand disqualified by the Supreme Court for not writing a letter against former president Asif Ali Zardari to Swiss authorities.He made it clear to the PDM that he would not spare them even if he loses premiership or goes out of parliament. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWhat was the reason that the parties that demanded open ballot in the past started demanding secret ballot,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he asked.He accused the PDM of putting the national interest at stake in every issue, including Financial Action Task Force (FATF) legislation, to save its corruption. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe corrupt parties formed an alliance, fearing accountability,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said.Suggesting that he will fight till the end against corruption and the corrupt, Imran repeatedly vowed in his address that he would not give any NRO to the opposition. The address was also aimed at re-energising his party members and voters, especially, youth of the country.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWhat example are we setting for our young generation by allowing the buying and selling of votes,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said. He recalled that he expelled 20 of his lawmakers from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after 2018 Senate polls when it emerged that they had sold their votes.Throughout the speech, he reiterated that the ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœsole purpose of his entering politics was to ensure the rule of law.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂHe said that corruption could not be curbed through laws alone, adding that the whole society plays a role in eliminating corruption by not inviting corrupt people to parties, by not accepting proposals from such people and making them feel that they do not belong to us.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœEnding corruption is the responsibility of the entire nation, not just Imran Khan,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said.Imran said that he would continue fighting against the ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœtraitorsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â; it was his faith that the good time will come and the country would progress when corrupts were thrown in jail.Also read: PTI gets the lionÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s share in Senate pollsWhile explaining the political situation in the country, he said that the country saw a sharp decline due to corruption after 1985, adding that the ruling classÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ corruption makes the country indebted.During his speech, Imran said that the PTI realised in the Senate elections that ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœmoney is usedÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â, but added that it was not a new phenomenon rather this practice had been going on for the last 30 to 40 years.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWhat kind of democracy is this,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said, noting that the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s leadership emerges from the Senate elections and the parliament, and the prime minister, cabinet members and ministers were chosen from among the lawmakers.He recounted the PTI governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s efforts for holding open vote in the Senate elections and how the ECP and the PDM

sheikh dwarfed the overall gains of the ruling party in the elections of the upper house of parliament.while the opposition is basking in the glory of their victory, the ruling party immediately went back to the drawing board to brainstorm a strategy to absorb the shock and deny the opposition any political advantage whatsoever from one senate seat that, according to rivals, symbolically means the prime minister doesnt command confidence of the house anymore.the opposition had a plan to use money in the Gilani-Shaikh contest, the premier said in a televised address to the nation on thursday. they spared no effort to break away our lawmakers and offered them money. their plan was to defeat hafeez shaikh to prove that imran khan has lost majority in parliament, he addedimran held the election commission of pakistan (ECP) responsible for damaging countrys democracy by failing to hold fair and transparent senate election. he said he would take a vote of confidence from the national assembly on saturday (tomorrow) and was ready to sit on the opposition benches than giving amnesty to the opposition.accusing the national poll supervisor of allegedly protecting those who made money by holding senate elections through secret ballot, the prime minister said that the ECPs failure to hold fair and transparent elections has damaged the countrys morality and democracy.the premier said that corruption took place right under the ECPs nose and what happened in the senate elections was a reflection of all the problems of the country.what was the reason that you [ECP] couldnt print 1,500 ballot papers with bar code, imran questioned. you [ECP] gave a complete chance to discredit countrys democracy and democracy was undermined by secret ballot, he said. conducting fair and transparent elections is the constitutional responsibility of the election commission.simultaneously, the premier threw down the gauntlet to the treasury benches lawmakers to openly vote against him if they felt he was incompetent during the assembly session summoned by the president dr arif alvi at 12 15pm on march 6.also read PDM yousaf raza gilani defeats PTI hafeez shaikh in major upset in senate electionsthe prime minister expressed his willingness to sit on the opposition benches rather than giving an NRO to corrupt politicians belonging to PDM a reference to the political amnesty given by former military ruler pervez musharraf through the national reconciliation ordinance in 2007.referring to shaikhs defeat and explaining why he opted for taking a vote of confidence from the national assembly, imran said the opposition wanted to take NRO by brandishing the sword of no-confidence but I dont want power I prefer the future of the country over it.the premier directly accused gilani of buying PTI lawmakers and criticised him for choosing to stand disqualified by the supreme court for not writing a letter against former president asif ali zardari to swiss authorities.he made it clear to the PDM that he would not spare them even if he loses premiership or goes out of parliament. what was the reason that the parties that demanded open ballot in the past started demanding secret ballot, he asked.he accused the PDM of putting the national interest at stake in every issue, including financial action task force (FATF) legislation, to save its corruption. the corrupt parties formed an alliance, fearing accountability, he said.suggesting that he will fight till the end against corruption and the corrupt, imran repeatedly vowed in his address that he would not give any NRO to the opposition. the address was also aimed at re-energising his party members and voters, especially, youth of the country.what example are we setting for our young generation by allowing the buying and selling of votes, he said. he recalled that he expelled 20 of his lawmakers from khyber pakhtunkhwa after 2018 senate polls when it emerged that they had sold their votes.throughout the speech, he reiterated that the sole purpose of his entering politics was to ensure the rule of law.he said that corruption could not be curbed through laws alone, adding that the whole society plays a role in eliminating corruption by not inviting corrupt people to parties, by not accepting proposals from such people and making them feel that they do not belong to us.ending corruption is the responsibility of the entire nation, not just imran khan, he said.imran said that he would continue fighting against the traitors it was his faith that the good time will come and the country would progress when corrupts were thrown in jail.also read PTI gets the lions share in senate pollswhile explaining the political situation in the country, he said that the country saw a sharp decline due to corruption after 1985, adding that the ruling class corruption makes the country indebted.during his speech, imran said that the PTI realised in the senate elections that money is used, but added that it was not a new phenomenon rather this practice had been going on for the last 30 to 40 years.what kind of democracy is this, he said, noting that the countrys leadership emerges from the senate elections and the parliament, and the prime minister, cabinet members and ministers were chosen from among the lawmakers.he recounted the PTI governments efforts for holding open vote in the senate elections and how the ECP and the PDM leadership argued against it, despite the PPP and the PML-Ns promise in the charter of democracy of holding the senate elections through open vote.meanwhile, army chief gen qamar javed bajwa and director general Inter-Services intelligence lt gen faiz hameed reportedly met the prime minister.although there was no word from the militarys

Securities brokers that would comply with enhanced net worth, corporate governance and compliance requirements shall be allowed to retain custody of investor assets. Small sized brokerage houses shall not be maintaining custody of customer assets and therefore will be subject to less stringent regulatory requirements.

SECP in collaboration with the PSX has introduced an alternative board, the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) to encourage smaller companies to list equity securities and avail the benefits of listing at the exchange. In order for a public company to be eligible to list at GEM, it should have audited accounts for the last 2 years and post issue paid-up capital of a minimum Rs25 million. The issuer may offer, by way of information memorandum, 10% of the post issue paid-up capital to eligible investors.    For enhancing ease of doing business and strengthening market participants, measures have been taken to reduce market costs for which fee structure of the PSX, CDC and NCCPL have been rationalized.Further, to increase the retail base, simplified account opening process has been introduced for low risk investors whereby maximum investment limit of Sahulat Account has been enhanced from Rs500,000 to Rs800,000.

Govt likely to allow cotton import via land route,2021-03-04,Tribune,"ISLAMABAD:As the country has become a net importer of cotton for the past three years due to lower domestic production, the government is set to allow cotton import from Afghanistan and Central Asian States via Torkham land route.PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s cotton harvest has shrunk significantly as farmers are switching over to other lucrative crops. Different countries have given agriculture the status of industry but PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s agriculture sector is being neglected constantly because of increased focus on textile barons.Owing to the low cotton production, the Ministry of Commerce is pressing the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) to permit imports from Afghanistan and Central Asian States.However, the ministry has not recommended cotton import from India due to tense ties between the two neighbours for decades.PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s textile sector consumes around 12 million bales (170,000 kg) of cotton per annum but production has fallen short of the requirement over the past one and a half decade.For the current fiscal year, the cotton harvest target has been set at 10.89 million bales, but in meetings of the Cotton Crop Assessment Committee, the output has been estimated at only 7.7 million bales.It is the lowest production level in decades. During 2013-18 tenure of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government, the output had dropped to nine million bales.With low production, the country needs to import cotton in an effort to bridge the demand-supply gap.Furthermore, Pakistan produces short-to-medium staple cotton whereas long and extra-long staple cotton is imported for manufacturing finer yarn for its subsequent transformation into high value-added textile products.Cotton is imported from various sources with the land route being the cheapest. It clearly indicates that Afghanistan and Central Asian countries are one of the top sources for supplies. As imports from India have been restricted, reliance has increased on Afghanistan and Central Asia for cotton import.According to Rule 28 of the Plant Quarantine Act 1976, cotton import is made only through the sea route since quarantine facilities are only available in Karachi. In 2017-18, a special dispensation was given in a meeting between PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s commerce secretary and AfghanistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s minister for industries and commerce.Consequently in 2018-19 and 2019-20, the import of cotton from Afghanistan and Central Asia through the land route of Torkham was allowed after approval of the ECC, provided that all sanitary and phytosanitary standards were met.Afghanistan and Central Asian States are economical sources for cotton import. Keeping this in view, the commerce ministry has proposed that imports from these countries may be allowed till June 30, 2022. It has sought ECCÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s approval in this regard.The Ministry of National Food Security and Research and the Commerce Division may engage importers for establishing facilities at Torkham for cotton import.

He explained that the government was also able to persuade the IPPs to agree on exchange rate of Rs160 at the time of agreements, as the rupee value appreciated against dollar though the original MoUs entailed exchange rate of Rs168. If the dollar rate exceeded Rs168, it would benefit the consumers more as the return would be calculated on the basis of Rs148, he added.When the Nepra chairman asked if the CPPA had analysed the benefit in case the dollar was valued at Rs170, Rs175 or more than Rs200, the CFO replied that their analysis was based on 5pc annual depreciation. Howeverate of Rs148, it would benefit the government in the case of foreign lenders but not in the case of local lenders.One of the IPPs representatives said the report of the Muhammad Ali Committee was not shared with the IPPs and whatever discussions took place was in the national interest. In response to a question about the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the Nepra chairman suggested that such questions should be referred to the anti-graft watchdog, as the petitions had come to the regulator for tariff adjustment.The CPPA requested that in case of foreign equity investment, the existing return on equity and the return on equity during construction components of 15pc return should be replaced with 15pc return with dollar indexation and fixed exchange rate at 14pc.

Cement: concrete revival,2021-03-05,Business Recorder,"The cement industry is demonstrating a remarkable recovery from losses to profits after demand in the country had a colossal reawakening. The industry has had a better year from every perspective: whether it is demand, retention prices, production costs or financial costs. Gross margins have re-entered the double-digit zone while profit margins turned green from a decided red this time last year.One can only speculate the origins of demand as cement manufacturers rarely sell directly to projects. No doubt, the construction package announced by the government in the midst of the Covid-19 outbreak has reigned in considerable interest from builders and developers eager to bag the amnesty scheme (no questions asked on source of funds) that comes with a fixed tax regime (FTR). However, it has been difficult to track progress of the package (or the Naya Pakistan Housing Program for that matter) as the FBR has provided precious little specificity on the 389 projects registered under the amnesty thus far. While several projects under NPHP have been announced (and approved), construction has not entirely begun. Industry sources suggest the current domestic demand is coming mainly from stalled construction projects that have been revived (particularly in Karachi), infrastructure and development projects as well as dam/hydro-power projects that have been greenlit by the government.   Volumetric growth in the domestic market has been up 16 percent in 1HFY21 while exports have maintained a 17-18 percent share in total dispatches for the industry. Including clinker exports, total dispatches for the industry have grown 15 percent. This reflects in the stellar performance of major cement companies (for the purpose of this analysis, 12 out of the 16 cement companies listed on the stock exchange have been selected).In 1HFY21, the industry raked in after-tax profits of more than Rs17 billion against a combined loss of around Rs930 million this period last year. But a lot more than demand had to change for this turn-around to truly emerge. Retention prices improved as offtake grew and though overall sales mix has not changed too much Ã¢Â€Â” exports have maintained share in total dispatches Ã¢Â€Â” the consolidated revenue per ton sold for the 12 companies grew 8 percent year on year. Companies have evidently sold at better prices locally Ã¢Â€Â” average prices of cement bags in the last quarter went up 5-6 percent compared to the previous quarter. Average coal prices have also been lower Ã¢Â€Â” in 1HFY21, average (South African) coal price stood at about $64.5 per ton, 4 percent lower compared to $67.45 per ton in 1HFY20. Accounting for a lag of about 2 months, average coal prices actually cost 10 percent less for the companies during the present period against last year. Energy efficient plants through waste recovery together with lower fuel and coal prices allowed the combined costs per unit sold to drop by a phenomenal 10 percent.  Meanwhile, policy cut from 13.25 percent to 7 percent allowed financing costs to shrink considerably as well Ã¢Â€Â” specially for companies that were heavily leveraged. Several companies (DGKC, Kohat, Lucky, MapleLeaf) in the industry have announced expansion projects and are availing reduced mark-ups under SBPÃ¢Â€Â™s Temporary Economic Relief Facility (TERF) that came in March last year.

The government had again notified the campus closures from Nov 26 and announced their reopening in Jan-Feb 2021.Zahidullah Zahid, Alamzeb Khan and other lawyers for the petitioners said despite clear orders issued by the high court and PSRA for private schools against harassing parents for the payment of outstanding fee, some educational institutions had constantly been pestering parents by demanding the lump sum payment of fee instead of installments.Parents call for relief during ongoing pandemicThey claimed that several schools had arbitrarily increased tuition fee though the PSRA had issued orders to them against increasing it during the pandemic and that they had been demanding annual fee and admission fee.Advocate Fida Gul appeared for some private schools and said several parents were reluctant to pay the outstanding fee of their children pending for last many months.He said parents had been misusing the earlier order of the high court and had not been paying fees.Zahidullah said although the order of the high court and decision of the PSRA were also highlighted on social media, schools had still not been following it.He contended that the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic had baldy affected the world economy and Pakistan was no exception to it.The lawyer said the pandemic had left billions of people jobless across the world and therefore, the low-income group of citizens faced the threat of starvation and not in a position to pay tuition fee of students.He claimed that in order to tackle with the ongoing pandemic in the country, the international financial institutions, including IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank, had extended financial assistance in terms of grants and loans, which, by the operation of the law, were part and parcel of the NDMF and PDMF and should be utilised for easing sufferings of students belonging to the lower and middle classes of society.The lawyer said despite the closure of schools for many months, different schools continued collecting tuition fee from students.Barrister Asadullah Mulk appeared for the PSRA and said in accordance with the directives issued by the high court, he had filed comments on the matter

Govt to privatise 44 entities by 2025,2021-03-05,Tribune,"ISLAMABAD:The International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed first review of PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s bleeding public sector enterprises has identified 44 entities for privatisation, including the power companies that are causing big losses, despite a 50% reduction in losses in the first year of current government.The review of 84 commercial state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has been completed as part of the structural benchmarks set by the IMF and supported by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB), according to the ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœSOEs Triage: Reforms and Way ForwardÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â report that the Ministry of Finance released on Thursday.The report showed that the government would retain 39 SOEs, but would privatise another 44. One company is planned to be liquidated. For the first time, the government has given timelines for the restructuring of the entities that have been retained and the privatisation of remaining ones.The timelines for privatisation show that no major loss-making firm could be sold before June 2023 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ the time when the country would be preparing for next general elections.The privatisation process for power distribution companies will be completed in four years. This is because of the requirement to first restructure these enterprises and then start the privatisation process spanning months.The progress on timelines will be monitored by the Cabinet Committee on State Owned Enterprises (CCoSOEs) regularly through the Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) being established in the Finance Division, according to the report.The SOEs Triage refers to a comprehensive review of the existing SOE portfolio for the purpose of categorisation for retention, privatisation and liquidation. It was initiated in November 2019 as part of the IMFÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s structural benchmark.There are around 212 SOEs including the subsidiaries. But the review report focused only on 85 commercial SOEs that mainly operate in seven sectors.The report showed that overall revenues of all the SOEs were Rs4 trillion in 2018-19 while the book value of their assets was Rs19 trillion. Additionally, the SOEs provided employment to more than 450,000 people, who constituted around 0.8% of the total workforce.The report showed that in fiscal year 2018-19, which was the first year of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, the commercial SOEs collectively recorded net losses of Rs143 billion.However, it stated that there was a 50% reduction in the losses compared with last year of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government when the entities registered net losses of Rs287 billion.The 50% reduction in losses was because of reduction in transmission and distribution losses, which according to the government were cut by up to 2%.It added that timely determination of tariffs by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) and the notification by the government during fiscal year 2018-19 after a lag of three years also led to the reduction in overall losses of the power sector. Former power secretary Irfan Ali played a major role in cutting the losses.The government said that its campaign against the running electricity defaulters also contributed to the lower losses in the first year of PTI administration.Similarly, the profit of Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDC), Government Holdings Private Limited and Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) increased by Rs59 billion, which reduced the overall net losses to Rs143 billion in the first year of PTI government.But the report underlined the concern that the financial performance of SOEs had declined over time, which was evident from the fact that in 2013-14, the SOEs recorded an overall net profit of Rs204 billion, which fell to Rs61 billion in the following year and declined further to an aggregate loss.Since FY2015-16, the SOEs have consistently incurred significant losses, putting a heavy burden on the governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s fiscal position amounting to Rs853 billion, according to the finance ministry.Over the past six years, one-third of the commercial SOEs have experienced losses intermittently. Moreover, the sum of losses of top 10 loss-making SOEs contribute around 90% to the total losses of SOEs each year.The National Highway Authority (NHA), Pakistan Railways, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and power distribution companies were among top 10 loss-making SOEs.Going forward, the government has prepared a plan for restructuring and privatisation of these enterprises. The report showed that among the SOEs performing core functions, 25 SOEs were profitable in FY2018-19.It said that four SOEs are categorised as financially viable, namely GHPL, Pak-Arab Refinery Company, Pak-Kuwait Investment Company and Pakistan Revenue Automation Ltd. Another 19 entities have been consistently profit making during the last three years through 2019. However, their returns on assets have been lower than the threshold required. Another two SOEs ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ CPPA and Pak-Iran Investment Company ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ have positive equity and were profitable in FY17 and FY19.There are 14 entities which are planned to be retained under government ownership but require immediate reforms and possible restructuring. Among them are Pakistan Railways and Pakistan International Airlines, which were collectively making a loss of Rs88 billion in FY19, are already under active restructuring and reform process. The Pakistan Post Office, Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), Pakistan Television (PTV), Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation and Printing Corporation of Pakistan are among those that will be retained by the government.The report showed there are 10 SOEs which are on an active privatisation list and are at various stages of the privatisation process. Pakistan Steel Mills is an important entity on the active list and is at an advanced stage of the privatisation process. SME bank is another loss making SOE which is on active privatisation list. In addition to these, partial divestment of OGDCL and PPL is also underway.Another 24 SOEs are identified for the next batch of privatisation, 12 of which were loss making in the first year of the PTI government. These entities had a combined loss of Rs156 billion, according to the report.Among the loss making SOEs proposed for privatisation, the major loss-making entities are eight distribution companies (Hesco, Iesco, Pesco, Sepco, Mepco, Lesco, Fesco and Qesco), one generation company (Jamshoro Power Company) along with Pakistan Textile City Ltd, State Engineering Corporation and Telephone Industries of Pakistan.The government has identified 10 SOEs for potential privatisation candidates and due consultations with line ministries have already been initiated. In FY2018-19, six entities were loss making with a combined loss of Rs38.5 billion mainly emanating from Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited (Rs18 billion), Sui Southern Gas Company (Rs14.8 billion) and

Covid crisis: Proposed plan aimed at providing fiscal space to developing states,2021-03-05,Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan has proposed a five-point plan to provide developing countries the fiscal space to recover from the Covid crisis.Prime Minister Imran Khan, in his virtual address to the 14th ECO Summit, stated that for Pakistan, the vision of the ECOÃ¢Â€Â™s regional economic integration was an essential component of a strategy to transform the tensions of geo-politics into dividends of geo-economics. He also reaffirmed PakistanÃ¢Â€Â™s abiding commitment to the ECO to the founding principles of the Treaty of Izmir, and to the full implementation of the ECO Vision 2025.The prime minister said that five-point plan proposed by him included; (i) debt relief; (ii) SDR creation and redistribution; (iii) concessional finance; (iv) mobilisation of climate finance, because that is another crisis looming ahead; (v) and ending illicit financial flows and return of stolen assets back to the developing countries.  The prime minister said that one trillion dollars every year, according to the FACTI, leaves poor countries to rich countries and tax havens. Apart from its health and economic consequences, the Covid crisis has exacerbated the manifestations of religious discrimination, xenophobia and Islamophobia in various parts of the world. We have witnessed this in our immediate neighbourhood. The COVID lockdowns have enabled the suppression of people in occupied territories struggling for their right to self-determination.The prime minister said that for all the leadership, I would want to point this out it is essential to reject any attempt to link Islam with terrorism and to link Islam with terrorism is the biggest injustice, which is being done, to Muslims in the world. Similarly, he said that Muslims must oppose attempts where Ã¢Â€Âœfreedom of expressionÃ¢Â€Â was used to cause pain to Muslims by denigrating the holy Prophet (PBUH).  At the UN, Pakistan, Turkey and the OIC countries have initiated a proposal for the annual observance of an Ã¢Â€ÂœInternational Day to Combat IslamophobiaÃ¢Â€Â, he addedThe member states of the ECO represent half a billion people and cover an area of eight million square miles, the premier added that Muslims form the geographical link on the Asian continent between East and West, and North and South.  We possess two essential pre-requisites for economic growth Ã¢Â€Â“ rich resources and enterprising people. We have the potential for much larger production and consumption. The prime minister said that in the Vision 2025, the ECO members have set themselves an ambitious agenda of enhanced collaboration Ã¢Â€Â“ in trade, energy, tourism, agriculture and industrial growth. We should undertake a mid-term review of the progress made so far, accelerate the pace of implementation, and deepen the scope of cooperation, he added.The prime minister said that in advancing our common objectives, we must take full advantage of our geographical location, economic assets, and political relationships.Regional connectivity and integration have been proven to be essential for rapid growth and development.  He further stated that enhanced physical infrastructure will generate economic activity, trade, employment, mobility, and cross-border exchanges.  Ã¢Â€ÂœPeace in Afghanistan is crucial to the success of such physical integration in ECO region. I hope that the successful culmination of the Intra-Afghan Negotiations will lead to durable peace and security in Afghanistan,Ã¢Â€Â he said.He said that he wanted to appreciate President ErdoganÃ¢Â€Â™s initiative in organising this virtual Summit. Convening the Summit in these difficult times is a reflection of collective commitment to the ECO, the prime minister added.  Pakistan congratulates Turkmenistan as the next ECO chair. But I especially want to congratulate President Ilham Aliyev on successful liberation of AzerbaijanÃ¢Â€Â™s occupied territories.  The prime minister said that in 2017, silver jubilee of expansion of the ECO membership was celebrated with adoption of landmark ECO Vision 2025 and the Islamabad Declaration. The focus of the present Summit Ã¢Â€Â“ Ã¢Â€ÂœRegional Economic Cooperation in the Aftermath of COVID-19Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â“ is both apt and timely as like the rest of the world, the member states of the ECO have been severely affected by the unprecedented health and economic crisis unleashed by the Covid-19 pandemic. The prime minister added that more than 115 million people have been infected by the virus and more than 2.5 million have lost their lives and the world is grappling with the pandemicÃ¢Â€Â™s multiple dimensions. The full extent of its health, social, financial and economic impact on our countries has yet to be fully determined.He added that it is evident that developing countries including the ECO member countries have been disproportionately affected, economies have contracted, trade volume has declined.  Poverty and inequality has increased. He said that we, in Pakistan, realised that we must prevent our people from dying from the virus and from hunger. He said that Pakistan faced these twin challenges like the developed world and pursued people and poor-centric approach and doing this very difficult balancing act, saving lives, securing livelihoods, and at the same time stimulating the economy are extremely difficult balancing act. He said that despite financial constraints, the government allocated an unprecedented US$8 billion to support the poorest and the most vulnerable households and then small businesses, with direct cash handouts and then subsidies to the poor under the Ehsaas (Compassion) programme.He said that the pandemic is not over and there is a need to ensure that peoples secure the earliest possible access to vaccines being produced but on an affordable and equitable basis. The vaccine must be declared a Ã¢Â€Âœglobal public good.Ã¢Â€Â  Because, actually, no one will be safe from the virus unless everyone is safe. Pakistan has begun its vaccination drive but it has only so far concentrated on the front-line health workers, which obviously is everyoneÃ¢Â€Â™s highest priority.  We must also address the economic impact of the pandemic. The world economy has contracted by five percent, he added.The prime minister said that because, Excellencies! one trillion dollars every year, according to FACTI, leaves poor countries to rich countries and tax havens. Apart from its health and economic consequences, the COVID crisis has exacerbated the manifestations of religious discrimination, xenophobia, and Islamophobia, in various parts of the world. We have witnessed this in our immediate neighbourhood. The COVID lockdowns have enabled the suppression of people in occupied territories struggling for their right to self-determination.The prime minister said that for all the leadership, he would want to point this out that it is essential to reject any attempt to link Islam with terrorism. To link Islam with terrorism is the biggest injustice, which is being done to Muslims in the world, he added.  Peace in Afghanistan is crucial to the success of such physical integration in ECO region. I hope that the successful culmination of the Intra-Afghan Negotiations will lead to durable peace and security in Afghanistan.Our priorities and goals are clear. I propose that we focus on the following six points:First, we need to recover robustly from the economic and health crises induced by the pandemic. We must mobilise the national and international resources required for this purpose. I request ECOÃ¢Â€Â™s support for my 5-point agenda which I mentioned earlier.Second, we must adopt a plan to build resilient healthcare systems to respond to such crisis in future. We must possess the capacity to produce the medical equipment and medicines essential to respond to chronic and infectious diseases.Third, we must develop an integrated transport network to facilitate both intra-ECO trade and serve as a pathway for trade between the major economies to our East and West, North and South. The Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad commercial cargo train and proposed Uzbekistan-Afghanistan- Pakistan railway links are important regional connectivity projects. In addition, linking CPEC with Afghanistan and beyond is vital. Fourth, we must implement the cross-border projects already agreed among ECO members, including TAPI gas pipeline and the CASA 1000. Establishing an ECO Investment Agency and organizing an annual ECO Investment Fair where investment-ready projects could be presented to ECO and global investors are ideas that can be explored.Fifth, studies indicate that our mutual trade, which is just eight percent of our total trade; this could be expanded ten-fold. Enhanced transport links will help. But, we should promote conscious measures for trade promotion; simplify border procedures; establish intra-regional institutional linkages; reinforce existing regional mechanisms like ECO Trade Development Bank; operationalise ECO Trade Agreement; and develop new initiatives like the Clearing Union.

I hope that the successful culmination of the Intra-Afghan negotiations will lead to durable peace and security in afghanistan, he said.he said that he wanted to appreciate president erdogans initiative in organising this virtual summit. convening the summit in these difficult times is a reflection of collective commitment to the ECO, the prime minister added. pakistan congratulates turkmenistan as the next ECO chair. but I especially want to congratulate president ilham aliyev on successful liberation of azerbaijans occupied territories. the prime minister said that in 2017, silver jubilee of expansion of the ECO membership was celebrated with adoption of landmark ECO vision 2025 and the islamabad declaration. the focus of the present summit regional economic cooperation in the aftermath of COVID-19 is both apt and timely as like the rest of the world, the member states of the ECO have been severely affected by the unprecedented health and economic crisis unleashed by the Covid-19 pandemic. the prime minister added that more than 115 million people have been infected by the virus and more than 2.5 million have lost their lives and the world is grappling with the pandemics multiple dimensions. the full extent of its health, social, financial and economic impact on our countries has yet to be fully determined.he added that it is evident that developing countries including the ECO member countries have been disproportionately affected, economies have contracted, trade volume has declined. poverty and inequality has increased. he said that we, in pakistan, realised that we must prevent our people from dying from the virus and from hunger. he said that pakistan faced these twin challenges like the developed world and pursued people and poor-centric approach and doing this very difficult balancing act, saving lives, securing livelihoods, and at the same time stimulating the economy are extremely difficult balancing act. he said that despite financial constraints, the government allocated an unprecedented US$8 billion to support the poorest and the most vulnerable households and then small businesses, with direct cash handouts and then subsidies to the poor under the ehsaas (Compassion) programme.he said that the pandemic is not over and there is a need to ensure that peoples secure the earliest possible access to vaccines being produced but on an affordable and equitable basis. the vaccine must be declared a global public good. because, actually, no one will be safe from the virus unless everyone is safe. pakistan has begun its vaccination drive but it has only so far concentrated on the front-line health workers, which obviously is everyones highest priority. we must also address the economic impact of the pandemic. the world economy has contracted by five percent, he added.the prime minister said that because, excellencies! one trillion dollars every year, according to FACTI, leaves poor countries to rich countries and tax havens. apart from its health and economic consequences, the COVID crisis has exacerbated the manifestations of religious discrimination, xenophobia, and islamophobia, in various parts of the world. we have witnessed this in our immediate neighbourhood. the COVID lockdowns have enabled the suppression of people in occupied territories struggling for their right to self-determination.The prime minister said that for all the leadership, he would want to point this out that it is essential to reject any attempt to link islam with terrorism. to link islam with terrorism is the biggest injustice, which is being done to muslims in the world, he added. peace in afghanistan is crucial to the success of such physical integration in ECO region. I hope that the successful culmination of the Intra-Afghan negotiations will lead to durable peace and security in Afghanistan.Our priorities and goals are clear. I propose that we focus on the following six points first, we need to recover robustly from the economic and health crises induced by the pandemic. we must mobilise the national and international resources required for this purpose. I request ECOs support for my 5-point agenda which I mentioned earlier.second, we must adopt a plan to build resilient healthcare systems to respond to such crisis in future. we must possess the capacity to produce the medical equipment and medicines essential to respond to chronic and infectious diseases.third, we must develop an integrated transport network to facilitate both intra-ECO trade and serve as a pathway for trade between the major economies to our east and west, north and south. the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad commercial cargo train and proposed Uzbekistan-Afghanistan- pakistan railway links are important regional connectivity projects. in addition, linking CPEC with afghanistan and beyond is vital. fourth, we must implement the cross-border projects already agreed among ECO members, including TAPI gas pipeline and the CASA 1000. establishing an ECO investment agency and organizing an annual ECO investment fair where investment-ready projects could be presented to ECO and global investors are ideas that can be explored.fifth, studies indicate that our mutual trade, which is just eight percent of our total trade this could be expanded ten-fold. enhanced transport links will help. but, we should promote conscious measures for trade promotion simplify border procedures establish intra-regional institutional linkages reinforce existing regional mechanisms like ECO trade development bank operationalise ECO trade agreement and develop new initiatives like the clearing union. sixth, to remain competitive, we must promote knowledge-based economies and this needs we enhance expenditures on research and development and focus on rapid digitalization especially extension of broadband to all parts of our countries.the ECO, as envisaged in the vision 2025, should engage in dialogues with other regional and international organizations. we could emulate some of the successful models of cooperation in the EU, ASEAN and the african Union."

"Interview with Ali Janjua, CEO, PayPro",2021-03-05,Business Recorder,"Ã¢Â€ÂœTransaction patterns have seen a paradigm shift towards e-payments during pandemicÃ¢Â€ÂAli Janjua is the Chief Executive Officer at PayPro, a local Fintech company that provides bill aggregation services and industry-segmented financial products with integrated digital payment solutions. Mr. Janjua is a multifaceted professional, with extensive expertise in payment systems, investment banking and private equity. Previously, he was a Principal at Karandaaz Pakistan. He has also served as the Director of Risk Management and as the Director of Corporate Finance at Easypaisa (Telenor Microfinance Bank).Below are selected excerpts from BR ResearchÃ¢Â€Â™s discussion with the PayPro CEO, focusing on the local Fintech space and how PayPro is carving a market for itself:BR Research: Starting off, how do you describe the policy and regulatory landscape affecting your business?Ali Janjua: In recent years, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has been actively formulating policies to support aggregators in acquiring digital commerce merchants. We are grateful to these authorities as they have been actively engaged in drafting regulatory policies and support products. Worth mentioning here is the RAAST payment system, which will enable ease of doing business for SMEs in Pakistan and also create the foundation of a digital ecosystem at large.BRR: What are the critical success factors for a Fintech like PayPro to become commercially viable in Pakistan?AJ: Policymakers are already trying their best to enable MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) to setup viable businesses, hence any fintech that can act as a catalyst of change for businesses will help increase the money velocity and the efficiency of the economy. The golden rule is to collaborate with everyone and help the payment industry.However, external challenges remain a major barrier to entry. These include limitations of market accessibility, the general willingness of businesses to transform from rigid conventional processes and lastly, making the consumer aware of the potential benefit of our service.BRR: Can you elaborate a bit on the challenges facing Fintech companies in Pakistan?AJ: Firstly, most MSMEs donÃ¢Â€Â™t have business bank accounts, which is essential for businesses to operate digitally and transform the way payments are accepted. This behavior has also been observed with regards to fear of taxation and declaration of business assets amongst the common micro-business owners. Secondly, while rising smartphone adoption means more people are able to use feature-rich applications and consume digital content on their mobile phones, the handset prices still remain expensive. This situation poses a challenge and should be addressed following the governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s policy to reduce taxes and customs duty on imported mobile phones. And lastly, changing behaviors of the mass population against paperless and towards digital transactions are also significant challenges.BRR: Tell us a little bit about your professional background and your motivation behind joining this Fintech company.AJ: Mr. Aly Khan (Executive Chairman, PayPro) and I had a long-standing interest in digitizing the payments space for SMEs in Pakistan. While I was working as a principal at Karandaaz, we identified ConnectPay as a tech firm with the basic infrastructure that we could build on together, and form our Fintech company as founders. We revamped ConnectPay, which at that time had a basic services model in alliance with 1LINK without any market viable products. We perfected our bill presentment platform and re-launched it as PayPro in January 2020, with the intention of providing a premier payments solution that would offer bespoke solutions for all businesses in Pakistan. We felt that for maximum effect, PayPro would start with the education sector and then move to other impact-focused sectors such as healthcare, logistics, insurance and digital commerce among others.Today, I can say with confidence that we have very strong relationships with almost all financial institutions of the country. I have previously worked as the Digital Financial Services at Telenor Microfinance Bank (Easypaisa) and that momentum of disrupting financial services is en force at PayPro. The company is passionate about creating Fintech products which enable transformation and provide convenience as well as simplicity to businesses and consumers, and push the economy towards a digital ecosystem.BRR: How will you describe the core service offered by PayPro?AJ: PayPro is a payments facilitator with partnerships with SBP-regulated PSOs/PSPs (payment service operators/payment service providers) such as 1LINK and International Payment Schemes. We integrate businesses to the banking system in Pakistan and in most cases provides bespoke solutions to complicated problems faced by businesses in various industries. As Pakistan's leading financial technology company, we are enabling enterprises to manage business operations effortlessly through smart invoicing, subscription management services and collection of payments via an extensive network of payment partners (banks, digital wallets and other financial service institutions).  We have successfully achieved the highest number of merchants in the payments facilitation space with approximately 500,000+ invoices raised. With an aim to digitize the MSMEs and the informal sector in Pakistan, PayPro has built its core payments and technology infrastructure which is extremely easy to use for businesses and consumers alike and has gained a significant market acceptance in a very short span of time. We are processing ten thousand transactions every month, with an exponential month on month growth rate.I find PayPro to be in the business of building platforms in order to expand the customer outreach for the new league of entrepreneurs and MSMEs emerging in Pakistan. Using customer data for value generation, we provide proficient management of business with better recovery of payments through digital channels, automated bill presentment and faster reconciliation, all while using the easy to operate and secured cloud-based dashboard. Helping the economy move towards paperless, secure and ecofriendly banking, PayPro provides financial services to customers with the convenience to make payments anytime and anywhere from their smart devices.BRR: What is the technological foundation of the products and services offered by PayPro?AJ: PayPro operates in a collaborative environment and intends to form strategic alliances with banking partners and other financial institutions regulated by SBP and businesses regulated by the SECP to serve the vast informal MSME payments sector. We are serving MSMEs with industry-segmented business solutions in order to cater specific merchantsÃ¢Â€Â™ requirements. For instance, with over 150 schools nationwide, PayPro has successfully deployed Ã¢Â€ÂœProEdÃ¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€Â“ an all in one School Management System which allows education institutions to digitize their invoicing process with digital bill presentment and automates payment collection and reconciliation.We have launched our internet payment gateway-enabled marketplace platform Ã¢Â€ÂœProCommerceÃ¢Â€Â to cater the needs of the growing Ecommerce industry of the country, enabling online businesses to accept local and international Visa and Master Debit/Credit card payments. We easily cater to brick and mortar businesses through its unique PayPro ID and URL-based payments. This has turned out to be a crucial payment solution for service providers. We have also piloted our Healthcare Management System Ã¢Â€ÂœProCareÃ¢Â€Â with renowned Healthcare facilitators and Club Membership Management System Ã¢Â€ÂœProClubÃ¢Â€Â with all major recreational clubs across the country.Moreover, we are also working towards solving the supply-chain finance management shortcomings through our distributor management solution. A comprehensive platform that tracks sales, orders, inventory and fulfillment as well as enables people, processes and partnerships necessary for products to find their way to the customers. PayPro is also developing an indigenous product to cater to the under-served segment of registered freelancers roughly estimated to be around 0.37 million, with an export contribution which amounts to Rs500 million.As a payment facilitator, we are well aware that cash still remains king for day-to-day transactions in the country due to the ease of accessibility. Hence, we have partnered with TCS, Meezan Bank, and other financial institutions for collection of over-the-counter (OTC) payments with PayProÃ¢Â€Â™s proprietary bill collection system. We have gone one step further in facilitating the customers during the pandemic by partnering with Bykea to collect cash payments right from their doorstep following the SOPs laid by the governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s Stay Home, Stay Safe campaign ensuring precautions against Covid-19.BRR: What is your revenue model?AJ: Our revenue model is based primarily on two sources. First is a convenience charge, which is fixed or a small percentage is charged on transactions Ã¢Â€Â“ this charge is usually borne by the merchant. Another source of our revenue is our subscription income charged from the clientele for utilizing our industry specific platform coupled with the invoicing and payment solution.BRR: What is your target market? And what kind of channels are you using to reach the potential customers?AJ: PayPro provides industry-segmented financial products with integrated payment solutions in sectors including (but not limited to) education, healthcare, e-commerce, distribution, logistics, etc. Our solutions automate and fast-track the entire cash cycle of businesses from invoice presentment to payment collection and reconciliation.We engage with customers in both direct and indirect ways.

Our technology stack allows merchants to consume our APIs and integrate with their existing ERPs backed by our implementation experts that help businesses with a seamless transition from conventional to digital.BRR: Who do you regard as PayProÃ¢Â€Â™s direct competition?AJ: Fintech space is an emerging market for Pakistan. Innovation is rampant and we are witnessing new players entering the market by securing investments from major local and international business groups. The challenge, however, is to become effectively operational under the digital finance infrastructure and regulatory regimes of the country, where method seems to be just coping up to the madness.With each Fintech having a focus on a different market segment, I donÃ¢Â€Â™t consider competition as competition. I believe Fintech players are all just touching the tip of the iceberg in Pakistan. The number of formal merchants is rapidly growing with spirit of entrepreneurship in the developing world and informal merchants remain proliferated only in terms of estimations. Any and every competitor has an untapped canvas to cover in this emerging new market or should I say, square one of a digital ecosystem.BRR: Do you have an indirect competition as well?AJ: Almost all Financial institutions, PSOs/PSPs and Electronic Money Institutions (EMIs) are one way or the other facilitating payment acceptance via the available licenses or affiliations. Be it C2B, B2C, B2B or international remittance, they are all supporting each other in an extremely collaborative environment.We have managed to stay at the forefront when it comes to transforming businesses from the ground up in Pakistan. Catering primarily to all sizes of businesses, we are trying to bring them payment solutions which also help automate and manage their cash cycle. PayPro has been progressing with its mission to transform the economy from its roots by educating business segments with the advantages of digital transactions and have been successfully pursuing the informal sector in the country.BRR: How is the business doing? Is there a noticeable change in performance pre-pandemic and mid-pandemic?AJ: With the current pandemic situation, transaction patterns have seen a paradigm shift towards e-payments, considering the precautionary SOPs followed by general public and SBPÃ¢Â€Â™s proactive initiatives to promote the use of online banking channels in order to curtail OTC traffic at banks. PayPro processed Rs1 billion in transactions from January 2020 to January 2021. In a span of just one year, PayPro has achieved the highest number of partners with about 80,000+ average monthly invoices raised.We are developing a more digitally-inclined mindset among our partners and we expect to triple the number of partners this year. Our focus remains to digitize & e-bank the informal sectors, which would lead to greater financial inclusion.Ã‚Â© Copyright Business Recorder, 2020","interview with ali janjua, CEO, PayPro transaction patterns have seen a paradigm shift towards e-payments during pandemicali janjua is the chief executive officer at PayPro, a local fintech company that provides bill aggregation services and industry-segmented financial products with integrated digital payment solutions. mr. janjua is a multifaceted professional, with extensive expertise in payment systems, investment banking and private equity. previously, he was a principal at karandaaz pakistan. he has also served as the director of risk management and as the director of corporate finance at easypaisa (Telenor microfinance Bank).Below are selected excerpts from BR researchs discussion with the PayPro CEO, focusing on the local fintech space and how PayPro is carving a market for itself BR research starting off, how do you describe the policy and regulatory landscape affecting your business?ali janjua in recent years, the state bank of pakistan (SBP) and the securities and exchange commission of pakistan (SECP) has been actively formulating policies to support aggregators in acquiring digital commerce merchants. we are grateful to these authorities as they have been actively engaged in drafting regulatory policies and support products. worth mentioning here is the RAAST payment system, which will enable ease of doing business for SMEs in pakistan and also create the foundation of a digital ecosystem at large.BRR what are the critical success factors for a fintech like PayPro to become commercially viable in Pakistan?AJ policymakers are already trying their best to enable MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises) to setup viable businesses, hence any fintech that can act as a catalyst of change for businesses will help increase the money velocity and the efficiency of the economy. the golden rule is to collaborate with everyone and help the payment industry.however, external challenges remain a major barrier to entry. these include limitations of market accessibility, the general willingness of businesses to transform from rigid conventional processes and lastly, making the consumer aware of the potential benefit of our service.BRR can you elaborate a bit on the challenges facing fintech companies in Pakistan?AJ firstly, most MSMEs dont have business bank accounts, which is essential for businesses to operate digitally and transform the way payments are accepted. this behavior has also been observed with regards to fear of taxation and declaration of business assets amongst the common micro-business owners. secondly, while rising smartphone adoption means more people are able to use feature-rich applications and consume digital content on their mobile phones, the handset prices still remain expensive. this situation poses a challenge and should be addressed following the governments policy to reduce taxes and customs duty on imported mobile phones. and lastly, changing behaviors of the mass population against paperless and towards digital transactions are also significant challenges.BRR tell us a little bit about your professional background and your motivation behind joining this fintech company.AJ mr. aly khan (Executive chairman, PayPro) and I had a long-standing interest in digitizing the payments space for SMEs in pakistan. while I was working as a principal at karandaaz, we identified ConnectPay as a tech firm with the basic infrastructure that we could build on together, and form our fintech company as founders. we revamped ConnectPay, which at that time had a basic services model in alliance with 1LINK without any market viable products. we perfected our bill presentment platform and re-launched it as PayPro in january 2020, with the intention of providing a premier payments solution that would offer bespoke solutions for all businesses in pakistan. we felt that for maximum effect, PayPro would start with the education sector and then move to other impact-focused sectors such as healthcare, logistics, insurance and digital commerce among others.today, I can say with confidence that we have very strong relationships with almost all financial institutions of the country. I have previously worked as the digital financial services at telenor microfinance bank (Easypaisa) and that momentum of disrupting financial services is en force at PayPro. the company is passionate about creating fintech products which enable transformation and provide convenience as well as simplicity to businesses and consumers, and push the economy towards a digital ecosystem.BRR how will you describe the core service offered by PayPro?AJ PayPro is a payments facilitator with partnerships with SBP-regulated PSOs/PSPs (payment service operators/payment service providers) such as 1LINK and international payment schemes. we integrate businesses to the banking system in pakistan and in most cases provides bespoke solutions to complicated problems faced by businesses in various industries. as pakistan leading financial technology company, we are enabling enterprises to manage business operations effortlessly through smart invoicing, subscription management services and collection of payments via an extensive network of payment partners (banks, digital wallets and other financial service institutions). we have successfully achieved the highest number of merchants in the payments facilitation space with approximately 500,000+ invoices raised. with an aim to digitize the MSMEs and the informal sector in pakistan, PayPro has built its core payments and technology infrastructure which is extremely easy to use for businesses and consumers alike and has gained a significant market acceptance in a very short span of time. we are processing ten thousand transactions every month, with an exponential month on month growth rate.i find PayPro to be in the business of building platforms in order to expand the customer outreach for the new league of entrepreneurs and MSMEs emerging in pakistan. using customer data for value generation, we provide proficient management of business with better recovery of payments through digital channels, automated bill presentment and faster reconciliation, all while using the easy to operate and secured cloud-based dashboard. helping the economy move towards paperless, secure and ecofriendly banking, PayPro provides financial services to customers with the convenience to make payments anytime and anywhere from their smart devices.BRR what is the technological foundation of the products and services offered by PayPro?AJ PayPro operates in a collaborative environment and intends to form strategic alliances with banking partners and other financial institutions regulated by SBP and businesses regulated by the SECP to serve the vast informal MSME payments sector. we are serving MSMEs with industry-segmented business solutions in order to cater specific merchants requirements. for instance, with over 150 schools nationwide, PayPro has successfully deployed ProEd an all in one school management system which allows education institutions to digitize their invoicing process with digital bill presentment and automates payment collection and reconciliation.we have launched our internet payment gateway-enabled marketplace platform ProCommerce to cater the needs of the growing ecommerce industry of the country, enabling online businesses to accept local and international visa and master Debit/Credit card payments. we easily cater to brick and mortar businesses through its unique PayPro ID and URL-based payments. this has turned out to be a crucial payment solution for service providers. we have also piloted our healthcare management system ProCare with renowned healthcare facilitators and club membership management system ProClub with all major recreational clubs across the country.moreover, we are also working towards solving the supply-chain finance management shortcomings through our distributor management solution.

Jab in the dark,2021-03-05,Business Recorder,"As summer saunters in, the air is heavy with trepidation. Pakistan is about to open all commercial activities and public places in 10 days while still reporting over 1,500 cases every day (7-day rolling: 1,356). Across the globe, the chants to Ã¢Â€Âœflatten the curveÃ¢Â€Â have quickly been replaced with Ã¢Â€Âœget the jabÃ¢Â€Â and all efforts have shifted in that direction. Pakistan it seems is trying to balance both without much success in either Ã¢Â€Â” so far.  New cases are nowhere near other countries such as Brazil that recorded 71,000 cases on Mar 3 or United States that despite the most promising vaccination drive still recorded 65,000 cases on the day. Or a number of other countries including France, Italy, India, Poland and Turkey that are all registering over 10,000 new covid cases every day. However, inoculations in these countries have also been swifter. Meanwhile, vaccinations will not cover even 25 percent of the urban population once they all arrive. 17 million doses of AstraZeneca are promised to arrive by July, of which 7 million are set to arrive this month. The first shipment of Sinopharm vaccine from China constituted 500,000 doses which covered 250,000 healthcare workers Ã¢Â€Â” 2 doses for each person. In theory, 7 million+ Chinese vaccine already used will cover about 9 percent of the urban population. But this also means Pakistan has to keep fighting on Ã¢Â€Âœflattening the curveÃ¢Â€Â front until the free vaccine from Covax arrives which will take another few months.  A major challenge is the inoculation process itself and the inadequacy of the public health infrastructure that may not be able to handle vaccinating 20 percent of the population. The anti-vax sentiment in the country is almost as scary as the pandemic too Ã¢Â€Â” the polio drive is a living example. In fact, a Gallup survey found that 49 percent of the survey respondents said they would opt out of the jab. Emboldened by propaganda videos and conspiracy theories, if half the potential recipients of the vaccine balk at the idea of the vaccine Ã¢Â€Â” especially those at high-risk of catching the virus, spreading the virus and/or experiencing the more dangerous symptoms of the virus Ã¢Â€Â” the outcome would be more than worrying. Specially if the leftover restrictions and precautions are also removed.   Doomsday scenarios notwithstanding, it seems consumers are getting less worried, not more. Most restrictions on mobility were lifted several months ago and people have gone back to the office after months of working-from-home. For those that have managed to stave off the virus (or be asymptotic, so blissfully unaware), life has more or less gone back to normal. In Dec, both the SBPÃ¢Â€Â™s Consumer Confidence Index and GallupÃ¢Â€Â™s quarterly survey of the same name showed consumers moving toward optimism about the future of the economy and their livelihoods (and financial health) since the start of this erratic year. If perceptions were considered to be the final verdict on the subject, one would rejoice. Alas they are not.","jab in the dark as summer saunters in, the air is heavy with trepidation. pakistan is about to open all commercial activities and public places in 10 days while still reporting over 1,500 cases every day (7-day rolling 1,356). across the globe, the chants to flatten the curve have quickly been replaced with get the jab and all efforts have shifted in that direction. pakistan it seems is trying to balance both without much success in either so far. new cases are nowhere near other countries such as brazil that recorded 71,000 cases on mar 3 or united states that despite the most promising vaccination drive still recorded 65,000 cases on the day. or a number of other countries including france, italy, india, poland and turkey that are all registering over 10,000 new covid cases every day. however, inoculations in these countries have also been swifter. meanwhile, vaccinations will not cover even 25 percent of the urban population once they all arrive. 17 million doses of AstraZeneca are promised to arrive by july, of which 7 million are set to arrive this month. the first shipment of sinopharm vaccine from china constituted 500,000 doses which covered 250,000 healthcare workers 2 doses for each person. in theory, 7 million+ chinese vaccine already used will cover about 9 percent of the urban population. but this also means pakistan has to keep fighting on flattening the curve front until the free vaccine from covax arrives which will take another few months.

The convenience of a rapprochement,2021-03-05,Tribune,"India and Pakistan have always had someone knocking sense into them. Rarely have they conceived a path of good by themselves. Moeed Yusuf, our veritable SAPM and the NSA, has done a whole lot of work on it. Other than the initial few years when the British had to work through the issues they had left behind the Americans took over to come in to keep the two feuding children of the Subcontinent from coming to blows. Sometime the two did come to blows and shattered the family china. This involvement of the US has increased ever since the two sides went overtly nuclear though that happens only when both are beyond themselves in anger and are on the path to mutual assured destruction. For other times they just let them bicker on. Kashmir and the Kashmiris thus continue to suffer under this quixotic broad-brush the world paints the two sides with. We remain muddled in legacy and core issues. Far more serious things have happened to reduce the fracas of South Asia to merely a bicker. China has reached the borders of Indian-occupied territory in Ladakh and with its muscle has reacquired what had always been its claim forcing the Indians to acquiesce to 1959 Line of Actual Control for peace. This has meant a readjustment of tens of thousands of square kilometresÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ territory in ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s favour. This came about without a shot being fired and both sides literally coming to blows in physical brawls. Geopolitics and force differentials have that kind of an effect. At the same time a change in the administration saw India on a limb in its northeast bereft of the cover it thought the Trump administration had held out to her. Joseph Biden instead wants to shift back to the progressive themes of global governance especially after reeling badly under the Covid pandemic. One-on-one India had no chance against China. It chose to cut its losses under newer geopolitics. Then there is an even bigger homemade omelette in AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Afghan problem. It isnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t as many here tend to believe, ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â˜to go or not to goÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” they are already reduced to 2,500 with a promise to evacuate entirely save some contracted security arrangement by May 1 this year; or the Democrats may lose the next election to Trump who will grill Biden and Co on charcoals for lacking the courage to implement what was decided in American interest. The issue for Biden is ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â˜how to goÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™. To go is determined and his previous boss had already declared Afghanistan and Iraq, AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s unnecessary wars. In its scheme to do what is needed in terms of going back home with the remaining troops the US needs Pakistan and its assurance of influencing the Taliban to let the peace plan take effect.This would have happened already since both the Taliban and Pakistan seek peace and an end to war but for the two spoilers: the Afghan government which wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t sustain without American presence in the form of boots-on-the-ground, and India which likes strife to persist to fish in the muddy waters and keep Pakistan diverted from a wholehearted attention to a simmering eastern front with India. BidenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s agenda only gets served if India can keep its finger out of the Afghan pie and to that end it must pause its kinetic and persistent mischief against Pakistan using Afghan soil. That much Pakistan has repeatedly conveyed to the US and those yearning for stability in Afghanistan. One of many factors for Afghanistan to find peace is to obviate the use of its soil by malignant powers in the region to pursue their nefarious objectives. There is no appetite for war in a world riven by pandemics and climate catastrophes. Biden will be asked what he did to control and end the pandemic even before he answers on the economy. For it to materialise US must put an end to its hostility with China and whoever else is needed as a potential partner. Russia may not count as much as it is a regressing power but China is the new leader of the world in both economic and strategic terms. In each of what Biden outlines as imminent concerns ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” climate change, pandemics and economic slow-down ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” China will need to be on-board to work out a common stratagem to help find the world new pathways.

One-on-one india had no chance against china. it chose to cut its losses under newer geopolitics. then there is an even bigger homemade omelette in americas afghan problem. it isnt as many here tend to believe, to go or not to go they are already reduced to 2,500 with a promise to evacuate entirely save some contracted security arrangement by may 1 this year or the democrats may lose the next election to trump who will grill biden and co on charcoals for lacking the courage to implement what was decided in american interest. the issue for biden is how to go. to go is determined and his previous boss had already declared afghanistan and iraq, americas unnecessary wars. in its scheme to do what is needed in terms of going back home with the remaining troops the US needs pakistan and its assurance of influencing the taliban to let the peace plan take effect.this would have happened already since both the taliban and pakistan seek peace and an end to war but for the two spoilers the afghan government which wouldnt sustain without american presence in the form of boots-on-the-ground, and india which likes strife to persist to fish in the muddy waters and keep pakistan diverted from a wholehearted attention to a simmering eastern front with india. bidens agenda only gets served if india can keep its finger out of the afghan pie and to that end it must pause its kinetic and persistent mischief against pakistan using afghan soil. that much pakistan has repeatedly conveyed to the US and those yearning for stability in afghanistan. one of many factors for afghanistan to find peace is to obviate the use of its soil by malignant powers in the region to pursue their nefarious objectives. there is no appetite for war in a world riven by pandemics and climate catastrophes. biden will be asked what he did to control and end the pandemic even before he answers on the economy. for it to materialise US must put an end to its hostility with china and whoever else is needed as a potential partner. russia may not count as much as it is a regressing power but china is the new leader of the world in both economic and strategic terms. in each of what biden outlines as imminent concerns climate change, pandemics and economic slow-down china will need to be on-board to work out a common stratagem to help find the world new pathways. if this is what bidens and the democratic partys future success is staked on he cannot be as audacious as trump was in supporting those meaning to take on china. india thus finds itself on a limb in the new construct.

SC judge stresses speedy justice for workers,2021-03-05,Dawn,"ISLAMABAD: Justice Mansoor Ali Shah of the Supreme Court has said speedy and fair justice for workers should be a priority of the judicial system, particularly the labour courts.Speaking at the concluding ceremony of a workshop held for judges of labour courts and members of the National Industrial Relations Commission (NIRC), Justice Shah observed that as dispute settlement managers, labour court judges should wear a Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½human rights capÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ while adjudicating cases, and make full use of the guarantees and rights articulated in the Constitution as well as national and international laws.This would protect the social, economic and human rights of the workers and achieve industrial peace, rapid economic and social growth in the country, he added.The workshop was held in Islamabad under a project, Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Trade for Decent WorkÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ funded by the European Union and implemented by International labour Organisation (ILO) in collineteen judges and presiding officers of the labour courts from all provinces along with two members of the NIRC and research officers from the Supreme Court participated in the workshop.Justice Shah called for continued training of judges particularly in alternate Labour Dispute Resolution (LDR), International Labour Standards (ILS), labour laws and Information and Communication (ICT) technologies to promote an adroit, robust and dynamic labour jurisprudence system.Deploring the absence of a celebrated judgment and little public interest litigation (PIL) around the settlement of labour disputes in the country, Justice Shah wished that the labour justice system could produce something that could be celebrated.He said only 30 functional labour courts in Pakistan were catering to dispute settlement and violation of workersÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ rights for a workforce of 65 million.

Telecom sector: Universal service subsidy requirement offsets fiscal revenues: WB,2021-03-05,Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The universal service subsidy requirement of telecom sector in Pakistan entirely offsets the fiscal revenues it generates through spectrum pricing and taxation, making broadband infrastructure a net recipient of public funds, says the World Bank.The World Bank in its latest report, Ã¢Â€ÂœPolicy choices can help keep 4G and 5G Universal Broadband AffordableÃ¢Â€Â, stated that in Malawi and Pakistan (but not quite Uganda), the universal service subsidy requirement of the sector entirely offsets the fiscal revenues it generates through spectrum pricing and taxation, making broadband infrastructure a net recipient of public funds. In such challenging environments, every dollar gained from spectrum fees translates to a dollar more of required public subsidy, leaving the governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s net fiscal position completely unchanged. Any attempt to raise government revenues through spectrum pricing simply generates an off-setting subsidy requirement, with no resulting net impact on the government finances, it added.The World Bank has emphasised that any reduction of spectrum pricing would need to be accompanied by a strong regulatory regime to ensure certain objectives are achieved.The spectrum pricing regimes need to have coverage obligations attached to avoid private mobile network operators (MNOs) cashing in on tax breaks via extraction of excess profits from highly viable areas. Achieving total coverage involves user cross-subsidization from profitable (predominantly urban) areas to (predominantly rural and remote) locations that are not commercially viable to cover, requiring incentivisation via regulatory instruments such as coverage obligations.The report noted that Pakistan, where current 4G coverage is much lower, it is more attractive to deploy 5G NSA (non-standalone) as the means of reaching universal service, says the World Bank.The cost of meeting the UN Broadband Commission targets across the developing world is estimated at $1.6-1.7 trillion over the next decade, approximately 0.5-0.6 percent of annual gross domestic product for the developing world over the next decade. However, by creating a favorable regulatory environment, governments can bring down these costs by as much as three-quarters Ã¢Â€Â“ to $0.5 trillion (around 0.15 percent of annual gross domestic product) Ã¢Â€Â“ and largely avoid the need for public subsidies. While 4G technology remains somewhat more cost-effective at the global scale, the 5G NSA can sometimes prove less costly at the national level, particularly for countries with relatively low existing coverage of 4G technologies, and a tendency to be capacity-constrained in terms of demand. Providing that governments make judicious choices, adopting fiscal and regulatory regimes that are conducive to lowering costs, universal broadband may be within reach of most developing countries over the next decade.The findings suggest that technological leapfrogging to 5G NSA can be an advisable strategy for countries with under-developed telecom infrastructure. While 5G is more cost efficient (per bit of data transferred) than previous generations of technology, the real choice faced by policy makers is between completing a partial 4G roll-out or beginning on an entirely new 5G roll-out. Hence, the existing level of 4G roll-out has a large impact on technology choice. This is the reason why it is cheaper overall to complete 4G deployment in countries such as Albania, Peru, and Mexico, where 4G coverage is already relatively high (85 percent-95 percent).  Whereas in countries such as Senegal, Kenya, and Pakistan, where current 4G coverage is much lower (30 percent-65 percent), it is more attractive to deploy 5G NSA as the means of reaching universal service, the report noted. In principle, it is possible to combine the cost reducing measures explored above by simultaneously permitting infrastructure sharing, while keeping spectrum pricing and taxes at relatively low levels. For the illustrative case of 5G NSA (W), the overall impact of adopting the full range of cost minimisation measures is to bring costs down by as much as 75 percent relative to the baseline, with Pakistan being a good example.For countries, where universal access to broadband is commercially not viable (such as Malawi, Pakistan, and Uganda) cost minimisation measures can make all the difference between universal service being commercially viable or not. For instance, in Pakistan in S2 (<2Mbps) commercially-viable coverage increases from below 10 percent to 100 percent when cost minimisation measures are adopted, leading to substantial savings in the requirement for government subsidy, which would otherwise have been as high as $5 billion in NPV terms.While 4G technology remains somewhat more cost-effective than 5G at the global level, the relative cost of these two technologies can be reversed at the country level. This means that the governments should carefully consider the choice between 4G or 5G NSA technology as the basis for their universal service strategies. The study finds that 5G NSA can be the lowest cost technology choice in many developing country settings, thanks to the added spectral efficiency it can provide, leading to a reduction in the number of required sites. This is the case in countries where 4G networks remain incomplete, reaching no more than 50 percent-60 percent of the population (such as Kenya, Pakistan, and Senegal), and indicates the potential for technological leapfrogging. The findings suggest that 5G deployment (specifically 5G NSA with wireless backhaul) is much more viable in capacity-constrained countries such as Pakistan, in contrast with coverage-constrained countries such as Malawi or Uganda, where 4G is competitive at providing low user capacities.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021","telecom sector universal service subsidy requirement offsets fiscal

Hafeez Shaikh down but not yet out,2021-03-05,Tribune,"ISLAMABAD:The ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf is considering the possibility of making another attempt to get Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh elected as senator from Punjab by de-seating Senator-elect Ishaq Dar, who has not taken oath of the office, cabinet sources told The Express Tribune.At least three cabinet members on Thursday revealed that the government wanted to retain Shaikh as the finance minister.They said that the key reason was ShaikhÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s connections in the international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), that were critical for Pakistan for the revival of the stalled bailout package.On Wednesday, Shaikh lost the Islamabad seat to Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) joint candidate Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani by five votes in the Senate election.The sources said that the government may promulgate a presidential ordinance to define a timeframe for the elected members of parliament and the provincial assemblies to take oath.It has been under consideration to introduce legislation to make it binding for an elected member to take oath in order to ensure the representation of the province or a constituency in the assembly, Asad Umar, the federal minister for planning and development, confirmed.The minister had been requested to comment whether the government was considering promulgating an ordinance to de-seat Dar and bring Shaikh in his place from Punjab.At present, there is no timeframe for an elected member to take the oath.In March 2018, Dar had been elected as senator from Punjab on a technocrat seat for a six-year term, which will expire in March 2024. Similarly, former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan has also not taken the oath as member of the Punjab Assembly since his election.Sources close to Shaikh said that the government has decided to retain the finance minister after his defeat, which jolted the PTI government and forced Prime Minister Imran Khan to go for a vote of confidence in the National Assembly.Shaikh is not an elected member of parliament and was made a minister in December 2020 for a maximum period of six months after the Islamabad High Court barred the unelected advisers to chair and become members of cabinet bodies.The six-month term, defined under the Rules of Business, 1973, would expire on June 9.The sources said that the government was not in a position to do any kind of political experiment at this stage by bringing a new finance minister who does not understand the language of the IMF.Shaikh on Thursday postponed all his scheduled meetings, including the meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet and the Executive Committee of National Economic Council. Shaikh was taking his time to let the political dust settle down.Pakistan and the IMF reached a staff-level agreement last month, which in the words of a high-profile bureaucrat is still ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœvery tenuousÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â due to so many strings attached for calling a board meeting.Pakistan needs to approve or introduce at least four bills in parliament during the next few days to get a date for the IMF Executive Board meeting, the sources said.These bills relate to amendments in the Nepra Act, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority Act, amendments in the State Bank of Pakistan Act and introduction of a new bill ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ the State Owned Enterprises (SOE) Bill 2021 in parliament.However, it would not be an easy task for the government to implement tough IMF conditions due to resentment expressed by the ruling party MNAs during their interaction with the prime minister this week, the sources said.Also, the ruling alliance does not enjoy majority in the Senate, which may make it difficult to pass the Nepra Act amendments that seek to impose electricity surcharges and give timelines for increasing power tariffs.The sources said that Pakistan also has to deliver on a few other critical conditions, mainly about imposition of new taxes, from now onwards till June.The successful implementation of these conditions would ensure the continuation of the IMF programme, particularly approval of the 6th review in July or August, the sources said.However, it would not be an easy ride for the ruling party to get Shaikh elected on a technocrat seat from Punjab. The ruling alliance has 192 votes in the provincial assembly compared with 173 of the opposition parties.In May 2018, the Supreme Court suspended the Senate membership of former finance minister Dar after he failed to appear before the apex court.The court gave orders for his suspension from Senate while hearing a petition filed by PTIÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Nawazish Ali Pirzada ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” who had received 12 votes as a Senate candidate on technocrat seat from Punjab against Dar's 155.In May 2018, DarÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s lawyer had told the court that Senator-elect Dar was suffering from left arm and chest pains resulting from a spinal issue in his neck and was not in a position to appear before the court.The apex court had summoned the former finance minister, who has been in London since October 2017 and was declared an absconder by an accountability court in a corruption reference.","hafeez shaikh down but not yet out ISLAMABAD the ruling pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf is considering the

which in the words of a high-profile bureaucrat is still very tenuous due to so many strings attached for calling a board meeting.pakistan needs to approve or introduce at least four bills in parliament during the next few days to get a date for the IMF executive board meeting, the sources said.these bills relate to amendments in the nepra act, the oil and gas regulatory authority act, amendments in the state bank of pakistan act and introduction of a new bill the state owned enterprises (SOE) bill 2021 in parliament.however, it would not be an easy task for the government to implement tough IMF conditions due to resentment expressed by the ruling party MNAs during their interaction with the prime minister this week, the sources said.also, the ruling alliance does not enjoy majority in the senate, which may make it difficult to pass the nepra act amendments that seek to impose electricity surcharges and give timelines for increasing power tariffs.the sources said that pakistan also has to deliver on a few other critical conditions, mainly about imposition of new taxes, from now onwards till June.The successful implementation of these conditions would ensure the continuation of the IMF programme, particularly approval of the 6th review in july or august, the sources said.however, it would not be an easy ride for the ruling party to get shaikh elected on a technocrat seat from punjab. the ruling alliance has 192 votes in the provincial assembly compared with 173 of the opposition parties.in may 2018, the supreme court suspended the senate membership of former finance minister dar after he failed to appear before the apex court.the court gave orders for his suspension from senate while hearing a petition filed by PTIs nawazish ali pirzada who had received 12 votes as a senate candidate on technocrat seat from punjab against dar 155.in may 2018, dars lawyer had told the court that Senator-elect dar was suffering from left arm and chest pains resulting from a spinal issue in his neck and was not in a position to appear before the court.the apex court had summoned the former finance minister, who has been in london since october 2017 and was declared an absconder by an accountability court in a corruption reference."

Meltdown on PSX after finance minister loses Senate contest,2021-03-05,Dawn,"KARACHI: The stock market witnessed a bloodbath on Thursday with red splashed across the board. The KSE-100 index opened with a massive loss of 942 points and within minutes caved in to hit intraday low by 1,073 points.The index closed with a loss of 882 points, or 1.91 per cent, at 45,279, with a huge sum of Rs143bn wiped off market capitalisation. Out of the total actively traded stocks, only 46 managed to edge forward while 358 sank.The behaviour of the market was as unexpected as the defeat of the government candidate in the Senate elections on the hotly contested Islamabad seat. Traders said that the governmentÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s setback in no way demonstrated its ouster, but panic gripped investors and weak investors thought it prudent to dump risky shares first and ask questions later. The investorsÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ fears were exacerbated over Covid-19 that caused 75 deaths on Wednesday, representing the highest number in three months. The troubles were compounded also by the unfavouere the rising US bond yields have shaken up global markets; the face of future international oil prices also remains uncertain until the outcome of the Opec+ meeting.After the initial sell-off, major participants tried to calm the market.

Partly as a result of return of sanity and partly due to the highly attractive valuations after the big fall, the bullishly inclined institutional investors rushed to lap up value stocks, which saw the index bounce back to recover all but 350 points.Past mid-day the index succumbed to renewed selling pressure by mutual funds, mainly due to meet redemptions. The figures released by the National Clearing Company of Pakistan showed all-out sell-off by mutual funds of stocks worth $21.57m. Much of the liquidity was mopped up by banks that took fresh positions in shares valued at $15.1across the board throughout the day. Brokerage Arif Habib Ltd calculated that the sectors that washed away most points from the index included cement (167 points), banks (142 points), E&P (71 points), fertiliser (71 points) and power (60 points). Stocks that contributed negatively included Lucky Cement washing away 67 points from the index, TRG (53 points), HBL (35 points), Hubco (34 points) and UBL (31points).The trading volume increased 9pc to 441.3m shares from 403.6m shares the previous day. The trading value on the contrary declined by 10pc to reach $135m as against $149.5m. The volume leaders for the day were K-Electric, Ghani Global Ltd, Byco, World Call, TRG and Unity Foods which collectively contributed more than 145m shares to the total turnover.Major market participants were unwilling to hazard a guess for the future. They said that political and economic uncertainty may remain for the time being as Dr Hafeez would no longer be able to hold the position of minister after six months putting all his economic moves under the shadow. But some analysts and marketmen retained optimism.Insight Securities stated that a positive journey in equity market would continue given strong external position under the direction of IMF programme, improvement at the fiscal deficit front and strong recovery in corporate earnings.

"Market watch: Stocks bounce back, partially recoup losses",2021-03-05,Tribune,"KARACHI:The stock market bounced back on Friday and recouped more than half of the huge loss of nearly 900 points that the benchmark index suffered in the previous trading session.During the day, the Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) for the week ended March 4, 2021 was released, which recorded an increase of 15% year-on-year, generating investor interest in bank stocks.Meanwhile, the international crude oil prices jumped more than 2%, hitting their highest in nearly 14 months, which also lent support to optimism in the stock market.Moreover, Prime Minister Imran KhanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s decision to seek a vote of confidence in the National Assembly on Saturday eased concern among market participants, which was caused by the shock defeat of Finance Minister Abdul Hafeez Shaikh in Senate polls.Index-heavy sectors like exploration and production, cement, banking and power attracted investment and helped the market sustain the 45,000-point mark.The KSE-100 index shot up at the beginning of trading, however, investors started booking profit soon afterwards. The investors resumed buying in the second half of the trading session and helped the index advance more than 550 points.At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 558.81 points, or 1.23%, to settle at 45,837.35 points.Arif Habib Limited, in its report, stated that the market partially recovered the loss suffered during ThursdayÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s trading session.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœInvestors largely banked on prime ministerÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s vote of confidence (scheduled for Saturday), which was further aided by the release of SPI (Sensitive Price Indicator) data that showed a surprise jump of 15% year-on-year, prompting active buying in banks,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â the report added.A jump in international crude oil prices also supported the otherwise lethargic exploration and production sector, which contributed to the positive momentum.Sectors contributing to the performance included banks (+135 points), exploration and production (+132 points), cement (+59 points), fertiliser (+52 points) and power (+51 points).Individually, stocks that contributed positively to the index included Pakistan Oilfields (+46 points), Oil and Gas Development Company (+42 points), HBL (+37 points), Lucky Cement (+35 points) and TRG Pakistan (+33 points).Stocks that contributed negatively were Colgate-Palmolive (-15 points), Pakistan Tobacco Company (-12 points), Adamjee Insurance (-2 points), PSX (-2 points) and Pak Suzuki Motor Company (-2 points).JS Global analyst Maaz Mulla said a recovery was witnessed as bulls dominated trading, leading the index to an intraday high of +668 points. It closed the session at 45,837, up 559 points.Total traded volume was recorded at 317 million shares with Azgard Nine (+3.2%), TRG Pakistan (+2.2%), Pakistan Refinery (+2%), Ghani Glass (+6.9%) and Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim (+6.7%) contributing a cumulative 99 million shares to the aggregate volume.The exploration and production sector gained ground where Pakistan Oilfields (+3.9%), Oil and Gas Development Company (+2.7%) and Pakistan Petroleum (+1.4%) closed in the green as crude oil prices rose in the international market.Cement and banking sectors also saw price gains where DG Khan Cement (+1.7%), Maple Leaf Cement (+0.9%), Lucky Cement (+1.4%), HBL (+1.8%), UBL (+1.7%), Faysal Bank (+3.1%) and Bank Alfalah (+3.2%) were among the major gainers.Investor interest was witnessed in the power sector as well where Kot Addu Power Company (+7.4%) hit its upper circuit while Pakgen Power (+6.8%), Lalpir Power (+4.5%) and Nishat Chunian Power (+2.5%) also closed in the green.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœMoving forward, we expect a similar trend to continue amid political uncertainty. Any downside should be viewed as an opportunity to build positions in cement, refinery and textile sectors,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â the analyst said.Overall trading volumes fell to 317.2 million shares compared with ThursdayÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s tally of 441.5 million.

Poultry: maize dynamics leading from the front,2021-03-05,Business Recorder,"As per monthly CPI for Feb-20 released earlier this week, poultry prices have once again leapt forward by an enormous 38.2 percent (over Feb-19), throwing expectations off taming down inflation out of whack. While many will insist that the wild ride of poultry represents peak food volatility and should as such be discounted, it appears poultry has found a new price level, one that has been long in the waiting.Why? The short answer is Ã¢Â€Â˜perceptionÃ¢Â€Â™ of maize supply gap. Although formal sector poultry players may place maize component in overall cost of poultry production at as low as 20 percent, it may help to recall that most of poultry farming in the country is still semi-formal. Mid-sized players raising poultry follow bare minimum feed standards and are more inclined to increase maize component for cost minimization. Since FY18-FY19 when rupee began its downward slide against dollar, semi-formal players began their increasing substitution of imported components such as soybean with cheaper Ã¢Â€Â“ and largely locally produced and procured Ã¢Â€Â“ inputs such as maize. Here it might also help to emphasize that while inputs such as soybean are a valuable source of protein, maize is a source for carb- rich diet, allowing growers to quickly fatten the broiler bird.Enter global demand for maize with a twist. After bottoming out in CY17 when per ton maize price averaged at $160, international maize prices have been on a bull run since January 2018, rising by a 13 percent CAGR in the past three years. As of Jan-21, global maize prices are at a 7-year high with little signs of relenting.  Although international commodity market has seen much worse in the past Ã¢Â€Â“ between CY11 to CY13, maize prices had averaged close to $300 per ton - the timing of bull run could not have been more unfortunate for domestic poultry industry. Over the past 18 months, currency depreciation appears to have made export prospects for maize particularly attractive, resulting in year-on-year export volume growing by 13 times in FY20, with a whopping 16 times rise in total Rupee value.Meanwhile, the lockdown sideshow proved to be an effective distraction for market dynamics. Uncertainty ruled over commercial demand for poultry as the economy flirted with on-again, off-again strategy viz permanent return of public attendance to schools, offices, restaurants, and wedding banquets. Because poultry has a limited and very short lifecycle, every time people went back homes, commercial demand took a dip, sending prices of day-old-chicken on a rollercoaster ride.  Further twist was added by maize crop performance in recent past. Over the past decade, improving yield resulted in healthy surpluses for several seasons. Anticipating another surplus year, it appears that the commodity traders went all in on maize export during last year, dispatching highest ever volumes on the back of improved unit prices in FY20.But it may help to take pause for a moment. If government supplied figures are anything to go by, even the highest ever export volume in FY20 was only about two percent of total domestic output. Thus, while the growth rate may have been significant, the absolute volume is not significant enough to cause a shortfall domestically, unless of course maize demand has risen dramatically in the last 24 months.Then why are maize prices increasing? Because the liberal trade regime for the crop has ensured that prices in domestic market remain pegged to international market movement. Thus, the fact that maize farmers have been doing tremendously well in the past decade has much to do with international commodity price that has been consistently inching forward for over three years now.Thus, before broiler becoming precious provokes a knee jerk reaction or leads to ban on maize export, caution is warranted. Growers have benefited from the bonhomie, leading to more acres being brought under maize cultivation and improved investment in inputs. Focus should be placed on improving crop productivity to ensure that output is sufficient to cater to both Ã¢Â€Â“ demand from local poultry feed segment as well as that of opportunist traders bringing in foreign exchange through export.Note: Domestic prices are extrapolated based on Lahore Monthly Wholesale Prices available in MNFS&R documents for up to June 2018. For the period between July 2018 Ã¢Â€Â“ February 2021, WPI index values for maize have been used to extrapolate domestic price level; and is as such indicative.","poultry maize dynamics leading from the front as per monthly CPI for Feb-20 released earlier this week, poultry prices have once again leapt forward by an enormous 38.2 percent (over Feb-19), throwing expectations off taming down inflation out of whack. while many will insist that the wild ride of poultry represents peak food volatility and should as such be discounted, it appears poultry has found a new price level, one that has been long in the waiting.why? the short answer is perception of maize supply gap. although formal sector poultry players may place maize component in overall cost of poultry production at as low as 20 percent, it may help to recall that most of poultry farming in the country is still semi-formal. Mid-sized players raising poultry follow bare minimum feed standards and are more inclined to increase maize component for cost minimization. since FY18-FY19 when rupee began its downward slide against dollar, semi-formal players began their increasing substitution of imported components such as soybean with cheaper and largely locally produced and procured inputs such as maize. here it might also help to emphasize that while inputs such as soybean are a valuable source of protein, maize is a source for carb- rich diet, allowing growers to quickly fatten the broiler bird.enter global demand for maize with a twist. after bottoming out in CY17 when per ton maize price averaged at $160, international maize prices have been on a bull run since january 2018, rising by a 13 percent CAGR in the past three years. as of Jan-21, global maize prices are at a 7-year high with little signs of relenting. although international commodity market has seen much worse in the past between CY11 to CY13, maize prices had averaged close to $300 per ton - the timing of bull run could not have been more unfortunate for domestic poultry industry. over the past 18 months, currency depreciation appears to have made export prospects for maize particularly attractive, resulting in year-on-year export volume growing by 13 times in FY20, with a whopping 16 times rise in total rupee value.meanwhile, the lockdown sideshow proved to be an effective distraction for market dynamics. uncertainty ruled over commercial demand for poultry as the economy flirted with on-again, off-again strategy viz permanent return of public attendance to schools, offices, restaurants, and wedding banquets. because poultry has a limited and very short lifecycle, every time people went back homes, commercial demand took a dip, sending prices of day-old-chicken on a rollercoaster ride. further twist was added by maize crop performance in recent past. over the past decade, improving yield resulted in healthy surpluses for several seasons. anticipating another surplus year, it appears that the commodity traders went all in on maize export during last year, dispatching highest ever volumes on the back of improved unit prices in FY20.But it may help to take pause for a moment. if government supplied figures are anything to go by, even the highest ever export volume in FY20 was only about two percent of total domestic output. thus, while the growth rate may have been significant, the absolute volume is not significant enough to cause a shortfall domestically, unless of course maize demand has risen dramatically in the last 24 months.then why are maize prices increasing? because the liberal trade regime for the crop has ensured that prices in domestic market remain pegged to international market movement. thus, the fact that maize farmers have been doing tremendously well in the past decade has much to do with international commodity price that has been consistently inching forward for over three years now.thus, before broiler becoming precious provokes a knee jerk reaction or leads to ban on maize export, caution is warranted. growers have benefited from the bonhomie, leading to more acres being brought under maize cultivation and improved investment in inputs. focus should be placed on improving crop productivity to ensure that output is sufficient to cater to both demand from local poultry feed segment as well as that of opportunist traders bringing in foreign exchange through export.note domestic prices are extrapolated based on lahore monthly wholesale prices available in MNFS&R documents for up to june 2018. for the period between july 2018 february 2021, WPI index values for maize have been used to extrapolate domestic price level and is as such indicative."

CTD was established in 1965 in GATT (now WTO) for economic development of Developing Countries especially issues related to Ã¢Â€ÂœEnabling ClauseÃ¢Â€Â, for provision of non-reciprocal trading preferences to Developing Countries, like GSP, etc. Ã¢Â€ÂœUnder PakistanÃ¢Â€Â™s leadership, the CTD would strive to work for expansion of trade & investment opportunities for Developing Countries,Ã¢Â€Â Dawood added.

Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½It touches on a host of issues, including the lack of provision of adequate healthcare to women, gender and sexual minorities, the discrimination between urban and rural areas in provision of healthcarsearch, and the abuse, harassment and discrimination faced by women healthcare workers,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ she said.

Called the Aurat Azadi March, the Islamabad version revolves around economic justice and the manifesto demands different actions that can help alleviate financial burden and pressure from the public at a time when the pandemic has left most battered. For instance, it asks for a reallocation of the non-combative defence budget toward social programmes, a reduction in taxes that can help with basic household needs and help people avoid falling into poverty, ensuring food security, support for essential agri-inputs, fiscal stimuli and more.  An organiser from the Aurat Azadi March explained how the current situation in the country, and the world in general, informed the manifesto. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½The pandemic has disproportionately affected women, minorities in our society,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ she said. The March's demands also take up patriarchal violence through the pandemic lens. For instance, they acknowledge that Covid-19 disproportionately added to womenÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s workload in terms of the care economy. Violence against women also increased leaps and bounds due to lockdowns and isolation. The manifesto outlined the many demands-cum-solutions that could help address these issues, including anti-harassment campaigns, the provision of shelters and acknowledgement of care work at home as labour.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½The manifesto focuses on the economy because it isn't really talked about a lot within our movement. The pandemic has had a deep impact on the economy, and as a result the marginalised have taken a huge hit as well. We made our current demands specific to the situation because there was so much to say and so much to address. There is a need to prepare for the worst, and we are currently living it,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½eshis year, Lahore and Islamabad are moving ahead with precautions. Karachi will instead be looking at a dharna (sit-in), where the crowd and Covid-19 safety can be managed in an easier fashion.  Speaking about the preparations in Lahore, the volunteer from the March said volunteers will be handing out masks and bottles of sanitiser during the event. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½We have reinforced the SOPs through our online content.

The Islamabad chapter raised funds specifically to source masks and sanitiser. They are also focusing on developing formations and SOPs so that safety is not an issue. However, last yearÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s event proved that there is more at stake than just the virus, and the organisers are also looking into security arrangements.

Measuring the impact, four years inThis is the fourth year that the March is being organised around the country. In this time, one unquestionable outcome has been the push for more conversations. Ahmed feels that topics such as consent and bodily and sexual autonomy have been brought to the forefront.  Change is coming, albeit slowly.

emphasis on sexual minorities. there is so much more that we wish to talk about and can improve on. we recognise that the feminist movement in pakistan has by and large completely ignored the

PM approves withdrawal of 80 income tax exemptions,2021-03-06,Tribune,"ISLAMABAD:Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday approved the introduction of Money Bill in the National Assembly next week to withdraw around 80 income tax exemptions and reform the tax laws to meet a prior action for the revival of $6 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.The IMF has asked Pakistan to withdraw income tax exemptions worth Rs140 billion through a new legislation but the exact quantum can only be determined once the government officially lays the bill in the National Assembly.The Income Tax (Second Amendment) Bill 2021 would seek to streamline the tax regime for non-profit organisations, listing of firms in the stock market, exemptions for oil refineries, special economic zones (SEZs) being setup under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the Independent Power Producers (IPPs), sources in the Prime MinisterÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Office told The Express Tribune.The National Assembly session would be convened next week to introduce the bill, said the sources. Prime Minister Imran Khan chaired a meeting to review these exemptions, which was followed by another meeting in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the sources added.On the input from Nadeem Baber, the special assistant to the prime minister on petroleum, it has been decided that some exemptions would continue, including depreciation allowance for the oil exploration and production companies and refining minerals, sources close to the SAPM revealed.Pakistan and the IMF reached an staff-level agreement last month for the approval of second to fifth reviews and release of the next loan tranche of $500 million, subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions.For the revival of the stalled bailout programme, the IMF had placed prior conditions of increasing electricity tariffs, introduction of new bills and withdrawing income tax exemptions.The premier took the decision to introduce the bill a day before he would take vote of confidence. However, he shot down a proposal for slapping Rs4 per kg federal excise duty (FED) on imported LPG, directing for taking up this proposal in the main budget.In the future, tax incentives will not be used as instrument for attracting investment, a member of the federal cabinet said.The objective of tax reform is to make tax code simple, plug existing loopholes in the system, reduce discretionary powers of tax collectors and tax practitioners and introduce automation to ensure transparency of tax system, said Prime Minister Imran Khan.The premier further stated that tax regime should be reformed and structured in such a way that it facilitates businesses and help the economy grow.The FBR has estimated the total cost of tax exemptions at Rs1.15 trillion, including Rs378 billion income tax exemptions. The exemptions from total income amounted to Rs212 billion and the cost of tax credits is Rs104.5 billion.Major exemptionsIn a major decision, the government has decided that the income tax exemptions available to the IPPs would be withdrawn in the future. The existing IPPs would continue availing the exemptions due to sovereign guarantees that cost the national kitty Rs27 billion last year.Similarly, tax credit for investment in balancing, modernisation and replacement of plant and machinery by the manufacturing sector that caused Rs65 billion revenue loss last year would not be extended beyond June 30.The tax exemptions available to the Real Estate Investment Trusts would be withdrawn, said the sources. Last year it cost Rs5.3 billion revenue loss. In yet another important move, the sources said, the tax credit on listing of new companies in the stock market is proposed to be withdrawn.The concessionary income tax regime, available to the prime ministerÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s low-cost housing scheme would be available till June 2024 and any project that will be setup after that would not be entitled to claim the concessionary rates, said the sources.It was decided that the income tax exemptions available to oil refinery investments would continue by the end of this calendar year. The decision to continue these concessions for another nine months was taken to get time to finalise an oil refinery deal with Saudi Arabia, the sources said.Some major changes will also be proposed to streamline tax regimes of the SEZs, export of information technology services, Sindh coal mining projects and start-up projects, said the sources.The NPO regime will be reformed to stop tax avoidance by the NPO sector. Instead of claiming tax expenditures, these NPOs would be given tax credits, said the sources. It was also decided that the direct deduction of donations paid to the NPOs would be withdrawn. However, tax credit equal to omitted exemption will be offered.Similarly, tax expenditure claimed on donation paid to Prime MinisterÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Special Funds for Victims of Terrorism, Flood Relief Fund, to the Chief MinisterÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s (Punjab) Relief Fund for Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), would be withdrawn.

Likewise, exemption on income from modarba, other than manufacturing or trading modarba, could be withdrawn. The income tax regime of the film industry may also undergo changes, said the sources.Pakistan will take additional revenue measures equal to 1.4% of the size of its economy or over Rs700 billion to achieve a tax collection target of around Rs6 trillion in the next fiscal year under the IMF deal.The FBR will need to collect an additional Rs1.3 trillion in the next fiscal year, including over Rs700 billion through additional revenue measures. The remaining about Rs600 billion is expected to be collected through its existing revenue base.The FBRÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s powers to declare any sector or industry as industrial undertaking, and the first-year allowance equal to 90% of the cost of plant and machinery to mobile phone manufacturers may also be withdrawn, said the sources.

BidenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s national security strategic guidance ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” an analysis,2021-03-06,Tribune,"As stated in the policy paper issued by the White House on March 3, Interim National Security Strategic Guidance has been issued to convey President Joe BidenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s vision for how America will engage with the world.The policy guidelines focus on six major areas including renewing the enduring US advantages so that she can meet todayÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s challenges from a position of strength; building back better economic foundations; reclaiming her place in international institutions; lifting up values at home and defending them around the world; modernising military capabilities, while leading first with diplomacy; and revitalising AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s unmatched network of alliances and partnerships.Threats or challenge to US interests include the global pandemic, growing rivalry with China and Russia, terrorism, cyberspace, climate emergency, rising nationalism, a battered economy, racial justice, receding democracy at home and abroad, authoritarian states and technological competition.The panacea to deal with the challenges the US administration faces has been found in boldly engaging the world to keep Americans safe, prosperous, and free. It requires a new and broader understanding of national security, one that recognises that AmericaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s role in the world depends upon its strength and vitality at home.Democracy has figured out prominently in policy guidance. Biden has acknowledged that democracies across the globe, including within the US, are increasingly under siege. He feels that democratic nations are increasingly challenged from the outside by antagonistic authoritarian powers. Anti-democratic forces use misinformation, disinformation, and weaponised corruption to exploit perceived weaknesses and sow division within and among free nations.Now we come to specific areas to decipher the policy and how it could affect our own region.Foremost is China. Biden feels that China, in particular, has rapidly become more assertive. It is the only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system.Russia remains determined to enhance its global influence and play a disruptive role on the world stage. Both Beijing and Moscow have invested heavily in efforts meant to check US strengths and prevent it from defending key interests and allies around the world.Grouping Iran and North Korea into the next challenge, Biden thinks that these regional actors continue to pursue game-changing capabilities and technologies, while threatening US allies and challenging regional stability.Terrorism and violent extremism have also been included in the threats posed to American interests.BidenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s response policy hinges on three broad principles: defend and nurture the underlying sources of American strength; promote a favourable distribution of power to deter adversaries from directly threatening the US and her allies; inhibiting access to the global commons or dominating key regions; and lead and sustain a stable and open international system.Another advanced shared objective is strengthening Nato, trans-Atlantic cooperation with the UK, Indo-Pacific alliance by deepening partnership with India and working alongside New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam, and other ASEAN member states.In the Middle East and West Asia, two factors have emerged prominently ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” the guarantee to IsraelÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s security through the Abraham Accords and wrapping up from Afghanistan. The message for Arab states is, however, conditional.Biden reiterates that the integration of Israel with its neighbours and resuming US role as promoter of a viable two-state solution will be ensured. The US will work with regional partners to deter Iranian aggression and disrupt Al Qaeda and related terrorist networks and prevent an ISIS resurgence. In the same breath, Biden indicates that he will not give US partners in the Middle East a blank cheque to pursue policies at odds with American interests and values.

Biden has clearly articulated that the US should not, and will not engage in ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœforever warsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â that have cost thousands of lives and trillions of dollars.

These are enumerated below:The current momentum of the Afghan peace process is witnessing spoilers in the Afghan government and the Indian strategic community who feel that the trajectory of US policy in Afghanistan will leave little room for the Doval boys to keep the Af-Pak region boiling. BidenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s policy to get out of ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœforever warsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â provides Pakistan a leverage to work with his administration for enduring peace.Another area where Pakistan can push is human rights and the treatment of minorities under the Modi regime in India and Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK). Major think-tanks providing input for the Biden team have recommended that while India remains a staunch ally of the US, especially in the Indo-Pacific, its human rights record and treatment of minorities under the Modi regime is creating anxiety in decision-making circles in the US, and, that India has to mend its policy on minorities, especially Muslims.Pakistan needs to encourage and activate its diaspora in the US as well as lobbyists to keep reminding the Biden team and staunch supporters of human rights of the Democratic Party in Capitol Hill about their stance on atrocities and human rights violations in IOK.PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s next important area of converging interest with BidenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s team should be the new Middle East being shaped by the Abraham Accords. Pakistan enjoys a special place in the Middle East across the great divide of the Persian Gulf and has maintained a balanced policy in the region. PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s geostrategic position in the region, combined with it being the only nuclear Muslim country, has placed it as the new pivot in the Abraham Accords. While the US has looked for strategic threat reduction of its allies in the Middle East, Pakistan will figure prominently in the changing dynamics of the region.The toughest call for Pakistan will be to look for a balance in the US-India and the US-Pakistan relations. While Pakistan can leverage its position in Afghanistan and the Abraham Accords, the US-India strategic partnership and collaboration in the Indo-Pacific region is something that will remain a big challenge for Pakistan. The Pak-China friendship and strategic cooperation vis-aÃƒÂŒÃ‚Â€-vis the Indo-Pacific alliance will limit PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s space, especially if other countries in the West and South East Asia start bandwagoning with the Quad. However, BidenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s choice of following TrumpÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s hard policy on China or softening of the policy will dictate the contours of the environment in the region.In a nutshell, Pakistan has substantial leverage to cooperate with BidenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s team, especially in areas of convergence, as highlighted earlier. Pakistan needs to analyse the possible scenarios emerging out of a change in the White House, and galvanise its intellectual community and Pakistani diaspora in the US to maintain a balanced policy.Pakistani security community and Foreign Office should go through the document to draw suitable conclusions, especially on how PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s leverage in the Middle East and Afghanistan can be maximised.","bidens national security strategic guidance an analysis as stated in the policy paper issued by the white house on march 3, interim national security strategic guidance has been issued to convey president joe bidens vision for how america will engage with the world.the policy guidelines focus on six major areas including renewing the enduring US advantages so that she can meet todays challenges from a position of strength building back better economic foundations reclaiming her place in international institutions lifting up values at home and defending them around the world modernising military capabilities, while leading first with diplomacy and revitalising americas unmatched network of alliances and partnerships.threats or challenge to US interests include the global pandemic, growing rivalry with china and russia, terrorism, cyberspace, climate emergency, rising nationalism, a battered economy, racial justice, receding democracy at home and abroad, authoritarian states and technological competition.the panacea to deal with the challenges the US administration faces has been found in boldly engaging the world to keep americans safe, prosperous, and free. it requires a new and broader understanding of national security, one that recognises that americas role in the world depends upon its strength and vitality at home.democracy has figured out prominently in policy guidance. biden has acknowledged that democracies across the globe, including within the US, are increasingly under siege. he feels that democratic nations are increasingly challenged from the outside by antagonistic authoritarian powers. Anti-democratic forces use misinformation, disinformation, and weaponised corruption to exploit perceived weaknesses and sow division within and among free nations.now we come to specific areas to decipher the policy and how it could affect our own region.foremost is china. biden feels that china, in particular, has rapidly become more assertive. it is the only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system.russia remains determined to enhance its global influence and play a disruptive role on the world stage. both beijing and moscow have invested heavily in efforts meant to check US strengths and prevent it from defending key interests and allies around the world.grouping iran and north korea into the next challenge, biden thinks that these regional actors continue to pursue game-changing capabilities and technologies, while threatening US allies and challenging regional stability.terrorism and violent extremism have also been included in the threats posed to american interests.bidens response policy hinges on three broad principles defend and nurture the underlying sources of american strength promote a favourable distribution of power to deter adversaries from directly threatening the US and her allies inhibiting access to the global commons or dominating key regions and lead and sustain a stable and open international system.another advanced shared objective is strengthening nato, trans-Atlantic cooperation with the UK, Indo-Pacific alliance by deepening partnership with india and working alongside new zealand, singapore, vietnam, and other ASEAN member states.in the middle east and west asia, two factors have emerged prominently the guarantee to israels security through the abraham accords and wrapping up from afghanistan. the message for arab states is, however, conditional.biden reiterates that the integration of israel with its neighbours and resuming US role as promoter of a viable two-state solution will be ensured. the US will work with regional partners to deter iranian aggression and disrupt al qaeda and related terrorist networks and prevent an ISIS resurgence. in the same breath, biden indicates that he will not give US partners in the middle east a blank cheque to pursue policies at odds with american interests and values. on iran, he hints that US will pursue principled diplomacy to address the iranian nuclear programme and its other destabilising activities.for Af-Pak region, there is a silver lining in the policy paper. biden has clearly articulated that the US should not, and will not engage in forever wars that have cost thousands of lives and trillions of dollars. the US will work to responsibly end americas longest war in afghanistan while ensuring that afghanistan does not again become a safe haven for terrorist attacks against the US.We had done an analysis of bidens projected policy in january, before his inauguration, which was published in a pakistan newspaper, and would summarise the recommendations, as these remain relevant after the

Finance Division opposes telecom fee in rupees,2021-03-06,Tribune,"ISLAMABAD:The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and the Finance Division have opposed the payment of fee in rupees, instead of dollars, for the renewal of licences of telecom companies.These companies have approached the court for the renewal of their licences, which expired in 2019. Sources told The Express Tribune that the telecom firms had demanded that the government charge the fee in local currency instead of US dollar.Last year, the government had set up a cross-stakeholder committee to address critical issues facing the cellular industry in a bid to promote digitalisation.The committee held consultations with the stakeholders and discussed proposals for biometric verification charges, benchmarking of spectrum fee in rupees and dispute resolution.The Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication has sent a draft summary of proposals to the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) for its review. The ECC will take up the issue in its upcoming meeting for final decision.According to sources, the PTA and the Finance Division have opposed the collection of licence renewal fee in rupees, saying the telecom firms should initially pay the fee in dollars.PTA has set the per megahertz (MHz) price for frequency spectrum in 900 MHz at $39.5 million and in 1,800 MHz at $29.5 million.

Mirza then went on to criticise the way in which the recently concluded Senate elections were held, questioning whether the Election Commission of Pakistan was able to guard the process against ""corrupt practices"". Earlier, lawmakers, including PM Imran, arrived at the Parliament House while PTI supporters and PML-N leaders gathered outside. Tensions were high as both sides became confrontational and PML-N leaders alleged they had been manhandled. Before the session began, Punjab CM Usman Buzdar, Balochistan CM Jam Kamal, Senate Chairperson Sadiq Sanjrani and other officials met in NA Speaker Asad Qaiser's chamber, where they discussed the vote of confidence. According to the participants of the meeting, the prime minister has ""set a unique trend"". The chief ministers, senators and other high-ranking officials watched the session from the galleries.The session started at 12:15pm with recitation from the Holy Quran and a naat without the opposition in attendance.

While the ruling PTI made gains, it experienced a shocking upset on the Islamabad seat where PPP's Yousuf Raza Gilani bagged 169 votes, defeating the government's nominee, Hafeez Shaikh, who received 164 votes, meaning that several ruling alliance MNAs had voted for the Pakistan Democratic Movement candidate. This is the first time a prime minister has undertaken such an exercise after the passage of the 18th Amendment.Prior to this, the law required every prime minister to take a vote of confidence from the Assembly within 30 days of being elected Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ a vote that Benazir Bhutto, Nawaz Sharif and other prime ministers ofter their election.Since 2010, however, the law does not require such a practice. In fact, according to clause 7 of Article 91 of the Constitution, the president Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½shall not exercise his powers under this clause unless he is satisfied that the prime minister does not command the confidence of the majorityÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ in the Assembly.Scuffle outside NAPTI supporters raise slogans in favour of PM Imran while PML-N lawmakers address reporters.

PML-N leaders, including ex-premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, Ahsan Iqbal, Musaddiq Malik, Marriyum Aurangzeb and Khurram Dastagir, also arrived outside the lodges and held a press conference to criticise the premier's move for a trust vote.Abbasi said the PM did not have the power to go for a trust vote according to the Constitution, adding that this powefidence of the legislature.  After the presser, however, the PML-N leaders alleged they were harassed and manhandled by PTI supporters present at the site, adding that there was no police or security for their protection.  A fuming Abbasi said such behaviour was reflective of the PTI's tactics and challenged them to a face off on the road ""in front of the cameras"".However, the PM's focal person on digital media, Arslan Khalid, claimed that the PML-N leaders began the scuffle by attacking PTI supporters around them, adding that the media was ""misreporting the facts"".

PakistanÃ¢Â€Â™s Cement Sector Outlook remains Bright says expert despite nominal growth,2021-03-06,Business Recorder,"With an uptick in construction activity expected, the outlook for the cement sector remains bright, says financial analysts despite the cement sector posted nominal growth in February 2021 as compared to February 2020.The sector posted growth of 1.98 percent in February 2021 as compared to February 2020. Total cement despatches during February 2021 were 4.577 million tons against 4.489 million tons despatched during the same month of last fiscal year.However, Ã¢Â€Âœwith winter in the rearview, construction activity is expected to pick up while medium term outlook remains bright on the back of various incentives being provided to the construction industry,Ã¢Â€Â says AKD Securities. Ã¢Â€ÂœThough political factors have put significant pressure on the cement sector and broader market lately, fundamentals of the sector remain strong and once political uncertainty subsides, we expect cement sector to again be among the frontrunners with players easily passing on the increase in cost coupled with demand remaining strong,Ã¢Â€Â it added. A number of cement producers have already announced expansion plans, as they expect strong demand in the near future.Companies such as Kohat Cement Company, Maple Leaf Cement Factory and DG Khan Cement announcing expansions of 2.3-3mn tons, 2.4mn tons, and 2.7-3.6mn tons, respectively.

Firm trend persists on local cotton market,2021-03-06,Business Recorder,"KARACHI: The local cotton market remained stable on Friday. Market sources told that trading volume was low because the stock of the cotton was low and the production of the cotton is very low. ICE cotton futures declined for the third straight session on Thursday, as a stronger dollar offset support from a federal report that showed robust exports of the natural fibre.Cotton contracts for May fell 1.04 cents, or 1.2% to 87.41 cents per lb by 1:54 pm EST (1854 GMT). It traded within a range of 87.4 to 89.39 cents a lb.The US dollar advanced 0.7% against a basket of currencies, making the natural fibre more expensive for buyers in other currencies.Ã¢Â€ÂœThe market has changed from a straight-up bull market to a bit of sideways issue,Ã¢Â€Â said Rogers Varner, president of Varner Brokerage in Cleveland.The market will likely trade between the mid-80 and mid-90 cent level, Varner added, noting that a decrease in ending stocks in the USDAÃ¢Â€Â™s World Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report due next week would be perceived as bullish.Prime Minister Imran Khan nodded to cross-border import of cotton yarn as the shortage of industrial input is feared to stymie recovery in textile exports.Commerce Adviser Razak Dawood said the Prime Minister showed his concern on shortage and escalating cotton yarn prices in the country during a meeting.Ã¢Â€Âœ[He] instructed to take necessary measures, including cross border trade of cotton yarn, to keep the momentum of value-added exports,Ã¢Â€Â Dawood wrote on Twitter.The government is considering import of cotton from India to meet the local demands, according to media reports.Cotton production came down to 5.5 million bales from as much as 15 million bales recoded annually in previous years, causing unstoppable rise in its prices.Textile and clothing exports increased more than eight percent to $8.8 billion in the seven months of the current fiscal year. The growth pace can slow down amid the shortage of raw materials, according to traders who called for duty-free imports of yarn from any country, including India.Pakistan Yarn Merchants Association expressed deep concern over the unavailability of cotton yarn and its price reaching to an all-time high. It asked the government to immediately allow duty-free import of yarn and cotton from India to save the textile industry from collapseIf export orders are not fulfilled on time, the business will adversely be affected, according to the association.The associationÃ¢Â€Â™s office bearers said a large number of export orders from China, Bangladesh and India were transferred to Pakistani exporters, which led to an increase in production activities. However, these days the cost has risen sharply due to non-availability of raw materials as per the demand of the textile industry and the high price of yarn in the local markets.Ã¢Â€ÂœIf we do not manage to import raw materials from other countries, including India, then export orders that have been transferred to Pakistan will not be fulfilled,Ã¢Â€Â the association said in a statement.Ã¢Â€ÂœThis will tarnish PakistanÃ¢Â€Â™s image in the world and we will not get new orders.Ã¢Â€ÂThe cotton production in the country witnessed an alarming decline of 34.18 percent shortfall as compared to corresponding period of 2020 when arrivals comprised over 8.5 million bales.According to the statistics released by Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association till March 1, on Wednesday exactly 5,631,191 bales underwent the ginning process i.e. conversion to bales. Cotton arrivals in Punjab were recorded at over 3.5 million or 3,501,580 bales, while Sindh generated just over 2.1 million or 2,136,169 bales.Cotton Analyst Naseem Usman told that textile sectorÃ¢Â€Â™s profitability increased significantly by 32pc YoY during the first half (July-Dec) of FY21 primarily due to an increase in exports, improvement in other income, and decline in finance cost.According to data shared by Topline Pakistan Research, the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s overall textile revenues increased 12pc YoY during the period under review, with exports rising 8pc YoY in USD terms and 13pc YoY in PKR terms. ToplineÃ¢Â€Â™s data regarding the listed textile composite sector is based on profitability analysis of 21 companies that represent 82pc of the sectorÃ¢Â€Â™s market capitalization. Ã¢Â€ÂœWhile the backlog of orders from 2HFY20 and diversion of orders from other regional countries like India and Bangladesh amid Covid-19 lockdowns/restrictions has helped support exports, the up tick in general pricing due to commodity super cycle has also played an important part,Ã¢Â€Â the Topline report read. The increase in pricing and depreciation of PKR/USD by 4.6pc YoY helped mitigate the impact of rising cotton prices, as gross margins remained largely unchanged at 16pc. However, gross profits increased by 9pc YoY.Naseem also told that rate of cotton in Sindh was in between Rs 10,300 to Rs 11500 per maund. The rate of Phutti in Sindh is in between Rs 4500 to Rs 5100 per 40 kg.The rate of cotton in Punjab is at Rs 12500 per maund. The rate of Phutti in Punjab is in between RS 4500 to Rs 6300 per 40 kg.The rate of Banola in Sindh was in between Rs 1600 to Rs 2000 while the price of Banola in Punjab was in between Rs 1800 to Rs 2250. The rate of cotton in Balochistan is Rs 12000 per maund. The rate of Phutti of Dalbadin Balochistan is available at Rs 6300 to Rs 6400 per 40 Kg. The Spot Rate remained unchanged at Rs 12200 per maund. The Polyester Fibre was available at Rs 215 per Kg.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021","firm trend persists on local cotton market KARACHI the local cotton market remained stable on friday. market sources told that trading volume was low because the stock of the cotton was low and the production of the cotton is very low.

traders who called for duty-free imports of yarn from any country, including India.Pakistan yarn merchants association expressed deep concern over the unavailability of cotton yarn and its price reaching to an all-time high. it asked the government to immediately allow duty-free import of yarn and cotton from india to save the textile industry from collapseif export orders are not fulfilled on time, the business will adversely be affected, according to the association.the associations office bearers said a large number of export orders from china, bangladesh and india were transferred to pakistani exporters, which led to an increase in production activities. however, these days the cost has risen sharply due to non-availability of raw materials as per the demand of the textile industry and the high price of yarn in the local markets.if we do not manage to import raw materials from other countries, including india, then export orders that have been transferred to pakistan will not be fulfilled, the association said in a statement.this will tarnish pakistans image in the world and we will not get new orders.the cotton production in the country witnessed an alarming decline of 34.18 percent shortfall as compared to corresponding period of 2020 when arrivals comprised over 8.5 million bales.according to the statistics released by pakistan cotton ginners association till march 1, on wednesday exactly 5,631,191 bales underwent the ginning process i.e. conversion to bales. cotton arrivals in punjab were recorded at over 3.5 million or 3,501,580 bales, while sindh generated just over 2.1 million or 2,136,169 bales.cotton analyst naseem usman told that textile sectors profitability increased significantly by 32pc YoY during the first half (July-Dec) of FY21 primarily due to an increase in exports, improvement in other income, and decline in finance cost.according to data shared by topline pakistan research, the countrys overall textile revenues increased 12pc YoY during the period under review, with exports rising 8pc YoY in USD terms and 13pc YoY in PKR terms. toplines data regarding the listed textile composite sector is based on profitability analysis of 21 companies that represent 82pc of the sectors market capitalization. while the backlog of orders from 2HFY20 and diversion of orders from other regional countries like india and bangladesh amid Covid-19 lockdowns/restrictions has helped support exports, the up tick in general pricing due to commodity super cycle has also played an important part, the topline report read. the increase in pricing and depreciation of PKR/USD by 4.6pc YoY helped mitigate the impact of rising cotton prices, as gross margins remained largely unchanged at 16pc. however, gross profits increased by 9pc YoY.Naseem also told that rate of cotton in sindh was in between rs 10,300 to rs 11500 per maund. the rate of phutti in sindh is in between rs 4500 to rs 5100 per 40 kg.the rate of cotton in punjab is at rs 12500 per maund. the rate of phutti in punjab is in between RS 4500 to rs 6300 per 40 kg.the rate of banola in sindh was in between rs 1600 to rs 2000 while the price of banola in punjab was in between rs 1800 to rs 2250. the rate of cotton in balochistan is rs 12000 per maund. the rate of phutti of dalbadin balochistan is available at rs 6300 to rs 6400 per 40 kg. the spot rate remained unchanged at rs 12200 per maund. the polyester fibre was available at rs 215 per Kg."

How vaccines became ammunition in global diplomacy,2021-03-06,Business Recorder,"Covid-19 vaccines are not just coveted as protection from the deadly virus, they are also a currency in the battle for global influence, experts say, especially between China and Russia.While the United States has been saving its vaccines for Americans, and Europeans struggle with delivery, Beijing and Moscow, as well as India, have been brushing up their prestige by sharing vaccine stocks with poor, vulnerable countries. Ã¢Â€ÂœGetting these vaccines into the arms of billions of people is now the most pressing challenge for the international community. This is, in a manner of speaking, the Ã¢Â€Â˜new arms raceÃ¢Â€Â™,Ã¢Â€Â according to The Soufan Center, a research body. China, which was already ahead of the game at the start of the pandemic with the distribution of masks, has been supplying several countries with vaccines, sometimes for free.Some 200,000 doses each went to Algeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe, 500,000 to Pakistan and 750,000 to the Dominican Republic.Ã¢Â€ÂœChina managed to present itself as a champion of the southern countries at a time when the north showed complete selfishness,Ã¢Â€Â Bertrand Badie, a professor for international relations at Sciences-Po university in Paris, told AFP.Russia, meanwhile, is proudly distributing its Sputnik V vaccine, named after the first satellites launched by the Soviet Union.At first derided in Europe, the vaccine has gained in credibility after a positive evaluation in the medical journal The Lancet.  Three EU countries Ã¢Â€Â” Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic - opted for the Russian vaccine without waiting for approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), as Europe struggles with long delays in vaccine dose deliveries. Ã¢Â€ÂœFor Russia, to show the world that ultimately it suffered less from the coronavirus than the United States, and that Russia is far more efficient (with vaccines) than western European countries, is a way to reclaim power,Ã¢Â€Â Badie told AFP. Ã¢Â€ÂœIn international relations, the image you project is decisive,Ã¢Â€Â he said, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin has an Ã¢Â€Âœobsessive will to re-establish Russian power, have parity with the western world, and to be respectedÃ¢Â€Â. Russia is, however, held back by its limited production capacity, and has had to share the spoils of new global influence with China. Beijing has helped Serbia to become continental EuropeÃ¢Â€Â™s Covid vaccination leader.Hungary has ordered five millions of doses from Sinopharm China, enough to vaccinate a third of its population.Ã¢Â€ÂœBeijing has been linking measures to combat the Covid-19 pandemic in aid recipient countries with the prospect of post-pandemic cooperation within the BRI framework,Ã¢Â€Â the massive Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure project, according to SWP, a German political research foundation.Ã¢Â€ÂœAbove all, Beijing wants to be perceived internationally as a Ã¢Â€Â˜responsible great powerÃ¢Â€Â™,Ã¢Â€Â it said.India, which is a vaccine production giant, has begun supplying its neighbours, including Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.Smaller countries are also using vaccines as diplomatic ammunition.Israel, considered as the world champion of vaccination, has supplied doses to Honduras, and also to the Czech Republic which is planning to open a diplomatic representation in Jerusalem. The United Arab Emirates has been supplying targeted donations to Gaza, a Palestinian territory under Israeli blockade, and to Tunisia.

Following Kashmir situation very closely: US,2021-03-06,Dawn,"WASHINGTON: The United States has assured the international community that itÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s following the developments in Jammu and Kashmir very closely and continues to support direct talks between India and Pakistan on the issue. The Kashmir issue has been raised regularly in the daily news briefings of the US State Department since the Biden administration came to power on Jan 20. Journalists, including those in the American media, seem eager to know how the new administration intends to deal with the age-old dispute between South AsiaÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s two nuclear powers, India and Pakistan. At the Thursday afternoon news briefing, a journalist reminded State Department spokesman Ned Price that India and Pakistan renewed their pledge to maintain peace along the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir late last month. Since then, both have avoided violations of a ceasefire agreement they signed in 2003 but peace remains tenuous. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½What the US Secretary of State Ante journalist asked.

The United States has consistently recognised Jammu and Kashmir as an area disputed between India and Pakistan, urging both to resolve this issue through bilateral talks. But last month, while welcoming the resumption of high-speed internet in the occupied valley, a State Department tweet referred to the disputed territory as Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½IndiaÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s Jammu & KashmirÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½.

A case of rampaging lawyers,2021-03-06,Business Recorder,"EDITORIAL: There isnÃ¢Â€Â™t much else to do, now that the Supreme Court (SC) of Pakistan has upheld the decision of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to Ã¢Â€Â˜demolish lawyersÃ¢Â€Â™ chambers and all illegal buildings on the football ground in Sector F-8, IslamabadÃ¢Â€Â™, except to demolish said structures and dwell on the series of incidents that led to this verdict. This is a very severe indictment of the way in which much of the legal community has come to consider itself above the law and the premier representative bodies, various bar associations and councils, that backed the illegal construction and defended all the lawyers that rampaged through the IHC on 8 February 2021.This episode gives rise to a number of very important questions that beg very urgent answers. Surely, lawyers that constructed their chambers on the ground knew very well that they were indulging in illegal construction, which is punishable by law. That they still did so, and reacted very violently when necessary action was finally taken, goes to show what little regard lawyers themselves pay to the law of the land, which incidentally they are groomed and trained to protect and practice. And the situation is made much worse by the revelation that some structures of the honourable court itself have also been erected, quite illegally it turns out, within the premises of the football ground. How could this be and why wasnÃ¢Â€Â™t this matter raised before the Capital Development Authority (CDA) appeared one fine night to reduce some of the illegally constructed private chambers, not the offices of the court, to rubble? And something must also be said about the behaviour of so many advocates. The bar and bench are, after all, two wheels of the judicial cart and when one tears the law to ribbons, to the point of holding the other hostage while it vents its own anger, and the other is made to decide on it, then the two wheels are forced to move in opposite directions. It is, in fact, shameless that lawyers reacted to being caught breaking the law by breaking the law further, disrupting court proceedings for hours, and harassing the IHC chief justice. And just when it seemed that the matter could not defy logic and sensibility any further, various bar associations and councils not only came out very strongly in favour of the lawyers whose chambers were demolished and demanded immediate release of all of their colleagues who were arrested for destroying court property and disrupting court proceedings, but also called for immediate sacking of the chief secretary and reconstruction of all demolishes structured, on the illegal land, at state expense. This trend, of lawyers turning into violent bullies whenever they are questioned, is one of the many unintended consequences of the so-called lawyersÃ¢Â€Â™ movement that dates back to General MusharrafÃ¢Â€Â™s time. And it has been growing in strength ever since only because relevant arms of the state have done nothing about it all this while. That is why it is very welcome that the honourable court noted in its judgment that Ã¢Â€Âœan advocate that takes the law into his or her own hands or violates the law in any manner whatsoever is not eligible to be certified by the High Court as Ã¢Â€Â˜fit and properÃ¢Â€Â™ to plead and appear before the august Supreme Court.Ã¢Â€Â That and the IHCÃ¢Â€Â™s order to suspend licenses of 21 lawyers that allegedly led the storming of the judicial compound ought to finally send the right message to this bunch, even though whatever limited footage appeared of that pandemonium clearly showed a much larger number of offenders than just 21. And there isnÃ¢Â€Â™t much video proof because the lawyers had the presence of mind to strip all present reporters of their cameras and smartphones.It goes without saying that nobody should be allowed to break the law, much less expect to get away with it. Yet there is considerable weight in the argument that lawyers as well as law enforcement officials commit a bigger sin than ordinary people when they cross red lines. That is because as representatives of the legal pillar of the state they are the very elements that deliver justice to the state and the people. And they know better than anybody else just when the law is violated and also the best ways of seeking justice. Hopefully, the legal community will itself take the lead in making sure that its members are not responsible for any further miscarriages of justice.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021","A case of rampaging lawyers EDITORIAL there isnt much else to do, now that the supreme court (SC) of pakistan has upheld the decision of the islamabad high court (IHC) to demolish lawyers chambers and all illegal buildings on the football ground in sector F-8, islamabad, except to demolish said structures and dwell on the series of incidents that led to this verdict. this is a very severe indictment of the way in which much of the legal community has come to consider itself above the law and the premier representative bodies, various bar associations and councils, that backed the illegal construction and defended all the lawyers that rampaged through the IHC on 8 february 2021.this episode gives rise to a number of very important questions that beg very urgent answers. surely, lawyers that constructed their chambers on the ground knew very well that they were indulging in illegal construction, which is punishable by law. that they still did so, and reacted very violently when necessary action was finally taken, goes to show what little regard lawyers themselves pay to the law of the land, which incidentally they are groomed and trained to protect and practice. and the situation is made much worse by the revelation that some structures of the honourable court itself have also been erected, quite illegally it turns out, within the premises of the football ground. how could this be and why wasnt this matter raised before the capital development authority (CDA) appeared one fine night to reduce some of the illegally constructed private chambers, not the offices of the court, to rubble? and something must also be said about the behaviour of so many advocates. the bar and bench are, after all, two wheels of the judicial cart and when one tears the law to ribbons, to the point of holding the other hostage while it vents its own anger, and the other is made to decide on it, then the two wheels are forced to move in opposite directions. it is, in fact, shameless that lawyers reacted to being caught breaking the law by breaking the law further, disrupting court proceedings for hours, and harassing the IHC chief justice. and just when it seemed that the matter could not defy logic and sensibility any further, various bar associations and councils not only came out very strongly in favour of the lawyers whose chambers were demolished and demanded immediate release of all of their colleagues who were arrested for destroying court property and disrupting court proceedings, but also called for immediate sacking of the chief secretary and reconstruction of all demolishes structured, on the illegal land, at state expense. this trend, of lawyers turning into violent bullies whenever they are questioned, is one of the many unintended consequences of the so-called lawyers movement that dates back to general musharrafs time. and it has been growing in strength ever since only because relevant arms of the state have done nothing about it all this while. that is why it is very welcome that the honourable court noted in its judgment that an advocate that takes the law into his or her own hands or violates the law in any manner whatsoever is not eligible to be certified by the high court as fit and proper to plead and appear before the august supreme court. that and the IHCs order to suspend licenses of 21 lawyers that allegedly led the storming of the judicial compound ought to finally send the right message to this bunch, even though whatever limited footage appeared of that pandemonium clearly showed a much larger number of offenders than just 21. and there isnt much video proof because the lawyers had the presence of mind to strip all present reporters of their cameras and smartphones.it goes without saying that nobody should be allowed to break the law, much less expect to get away with it. yet there is considerable weight in the argument that lawyers as well as law enforcement officials commit a bigger sin than ordinary people when they cross red lines. that is because as representatives of the legal pillar of the state they are the very elements that deliver justice to the state and the people. and they know better than anybody else just when the law is violated and also the best ways of seeking justice. hopefully, the legal community will itself take the lead in making sure that its members are not responsible for any further miscarriages of justice."

"Asia rice: Prices steady in most hubs, BD mulls another import duty cut",2021-03-06,Business Recorder,"VIETNAM: Rice export rates held steady in most Asian hubs this week as new supply from fresh harvests trickle in, while Bangladesh mulled another cut to import duties to bolster dwindling domestic reserves.ThailandÃ¢Â€Â™s benchmark 5% broken rice prices widened slightly to $515-$560 per tonne, from $520-$560 last week.Muted demand, optimism over a new off-season harvest and the weakening of the baht against the US dollar, have pressured prices, Bangkok-based traders said.VietnamÃ¢Â€Â™s 5% broken rice rates were unchanged from last week at $505-$510 per tonne.Ã¢Â€ÂœThis is just nominal price as not many new contracts have been signed recently as importers are still waiting further until the winter-spring harvest peaks,Ã¢Â€Â a trader based in Ho Chi Minh City said.Meanwhile, domestic rice prices are edging down on rising supplies from the main harvest in the Mekong Delta, traders said.VietnamÃ¢Â€Â™s rice shipments in the January-February period are forecast to drop 31.4% from a year earlier to 638,000 tonnes. .Bangladesh is considering further slashing duty on rice imports in an effort to bolster reserves and cool record local prices, a food ministry official said.This would follow a cut to 25% from 62.5% in late December.Bangladesh, traditionally the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s third-biggest rice producer, has emerged as a big importer lately due to depleted stocks and record prices after repeated flooding ravaged its crop.Prices for IndiaÃ¢Â€Â™s 5 percent broken parboiled variety were steady at $393-$399 per tonne amid rising supplies from the new season crop.Ã¢Â€ÂœRupee has been quite volatile in the last few days.

Pakistani rupee enjoys smart recovery as economy up,2021-03-07,Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's rupee has staged a smart recovery against the US dollar on positive economic indicators, and experts believe it will continue its upward trend despite some challenges ahead, report published in Khaleej Times said .Analysts and market experts said the currency will be a major beneficiary of higher GDP growth, rising foreign exchange reserves and consistent remittances inflows of over $2 billion during the first eight months of the current 2020-21 financial year.The rupee has so far appreciated 1.7 per cent against the dollar this year and closed at 157.12 on the interbank market on Friday. Against the UAE dirham, it ended slightly up at 42.77 against 43.6 on January 8, reflecting an appreciation of 1.9 per cent, newspaper said.Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Pakistani rupee has returned to stability chiefly due to higher remittances, debt relief on account of Covid-19 payment relief plan and economic rebound in the country,Ã¢Â€Â experts said.Latest central bank data indicates that PakistanÃ¢Â€Â™s economy is expected to post 2.5 per cent GDP growth in the current fiscal year ending June 2021 after contracting 0.4 per cent last year as the governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s policy measures start yielding positive results.The country registered a 24 per cent year-on-year increase in workersÃ¢Â€Â™ remittances to $16.5 billion during the July 2020-January 2021 period, while foreign exchange reserves rose to $20.13 billion during the week ended February 26 from $20.04 billion a week ago, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).Ã¢Â€ÂœThe forex reserves held by the central bank increased $70 million to $12.978 billion due to the governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s official inflows. The foreign exchange reserves of commercial banks also increased to $7.155 billion from $7.132 billion,Ã¢Â€Â the SBP said.The central bank data also showed that PakistanÃ¢Â€Â™s current account deficit shrank by 55 per cent on a year-on-year basis to $229 million in January from $512 million in the same month last year due to rising exports and higher remittances.In an interview with Khaleej Times, Devesh Mamtani, chief market strategist at Century Financial, said the rupee sustained an upward trend on account of positive economic indicators.Ã¢Â€ÂœFrom a high of 168 against the US dollar seen during the last year when pandemic started, the rupee has appreciated by 6.5 per cent and is currently trading near 158 levels. A wave of positive factors have helped the rupee to gain strength over the past year. This includes factors like resumption of the IMFÃ¢Â€Â™s [International Monetary FundÃ¢Â€Â™s] $6 billion lending facility, narrowing of current account deficit and G20 lendersÃ¢Â€Â™ agreement for a second debt relief for Pakistani economy. The resumption of the IMF bailout programme is especially a huge win for the economy as had it been stalled last year owing to the pandemic,Ã¢Â€Â Mamtani said.About the rupeeÃ¢Â€Â™s outlook in 2021, he said its future primarily hinges on full availability of the bailout package as well the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s success in raising additional funds through bond issuance. Ã¢Â€ÂœThe IMF facility will help country win over international investors when it seeks to raise more than $1.5 billion through global bond sales. This is required in order to plug the budget deficit gap, which is currently set at 7.5 per cent of GDP,Ã¢Â€Â Mamtani said.He said the IMFÃ¢Â€Â™s return is definitely a big positive for the rupee as well as the economy. Ã¢Â€ÂœSuccessful completion of this will likely see funds of around $500 million flowing into the economy. The IMF plans also create optimism regarding the economy with larger and global institutional investors, who will be reluctant to invest and spend without any IMF presence,Ã¢Â€Â he said.Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pakistan Kuwait Investment Company, said the rupee is likely to appreciate against the US dollar on account on positive economic indicators as well as stability in the economy.Ã¢Â€ÂœMain reason for the rupeeÃ¢Â€Â™s appreciation is stronger inflows under Roshan Digital Accounts and higher remittances during this financial year. Pakistan has also started availing certain lending facilities to pay for petroleum products,Ã¢Â€Â he added.To a question, he said resumption of the IMF plan will further strengthen the rupee in the near future.Ã¢Â€ÂœThe IMF plan is expected to firm up repayments of existing loans as well as strengthen forex reserves of the country,Ã¢Â€Â he said.Ã¢Â€ÂœI expect the rupee may depreciate by two to three per cent against the greenback this year.Ã¢Â€ÂAbout the impact of Financial Action Task ForceÃ¢Â€Â™s (FATFÃ¢Â€Â™s)  decision on the grey list, Tariq said the currency will not be impacted by this Ã¢Â€Â” be it grey or white.Ã¢Â€ÂœI think that we are already seeing significant inflows despite being in the grey list. Supply of the US dollar is getting better with the introduction of new channels for inflows and liberalisation of the forex regime, so those seem more important than FATF at the moment,Ã¢Â€Â he said.Muhammad Nafees, vice-president for finance at the Pakistan Business Council, said the value of a currency is directly related with the current account position.Ã¢Â€ÂœThe Pakistan economy is getting better every day. An increase in remittances from overseas Pakistanis, investment in Roshan Digital Accounts, increase in exports and decrease in import of non-essential items have contributed to the increase in the value of the currency,Ã¢Â€Â he said as quoted by Khaleej Times.Further, he said China Pakistan Ecomomic Corridor (CPEC) prospects are getting brighter and more and more countries are realising the importance of this project.Ã¢Â€ÂœIt will further support the value of the rupee.

Govt seeks economic re-engagement with US administration,2021-03-07,Tribune,"ISLAMABAD:The government has formed an apex committee to find avenues for economic reengagement with the new US administration, including a possibility of seeking investment under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.The 14-member ministerial apex committee will meet next week at the Foreign Office to discuss a range of economic and commercial proposals to warm ties with the US. The matters of national security and defence cooperation are not on the table, the official documents show. The maiden meeting agenda suggests that the ruling Pakistan Tehreeke-Insaf wants to revive economic ties with Washington after a phase of slow progress on the CPEC during the past twoand-a-half years.Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has been made the chairman of the apex committee. The ministers for finance, national food security, economic affairs, information technology, national security adviser, and PMÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s aides on commerce, climate change, human resource development, power and investment are the members of the committee.The ruling PTI wants to re-engage the Joe Biden administration in areas of trade, investment, energy and economic cooperation, which had also remained the common grounds for discussion during former president Barack ObamaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s term. A recent policy paper by Tabadlab ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ an independent think tank ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ had suggested that Pakistan must leverage the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economic potential rather than banking on geostrategic location while dealing with BidenÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s America. Going forward, the Ministry of Finance has sought the US support to keep the financing lines with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank open, the sources said.The US had bailed out Pakistan by exerting its influence on the IMF to waive core conditions of the last programme. PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s decision to join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) of President Xi in June 2013 had put the US-Pakistan economic relations in cold storage. During former president TrumpÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s tenure, the US did not appoint a full-time ambassador to Islamabad, while reducing the official-level engagement to the level of assistant secretary of state.However, the CPEC, which is the flagship project of the BRI, has been slowed down during the last almost three years. The government has not been able to secure a date from China for the 10th Joint Cooperation Committee of the CPEC meeting during the last six months due to its failure to show tangible progress on the CPEC projects, according to sources in the Ministry of Planning.The Board of Investment (BoI) has proposed that through CPEC, Pakistan can offer certain areas of cooperation to the US but ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœbut we need to be cognizant of the sensitivities of both the US and ChinaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â. In the past, China had not agreed to PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s proposal to include Saudi Arabia in the CPEC framework. The BoI has also proposed to attract more US foreign direct investment in Pakistan, especially through technology firms. The BoI also seeks US investment through special incentive regimes.The Ministry of Commerce has suggested that an American-Pakistan Economic Zone could be set up near Karachi port to allow reprocessing at concessional rates. It has also proposed to enhance structured engagement through TIFA Ministerial Council and Business Opportunities Conference. Last time, the TIFA council meeting was held in May 2019. The US-Pakistan TIFA is the primary mechanism for both countries to discuss trade and investment issues and focus on ways to strengthen the bilateral relationship.The United States continues to be PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s largest market for exports The Ministry of Commerce has also sought early finalisation of proposed legislation on Reconstruction Opportunity Zones, which had been promised by the Bush administration in return for PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s support to the US war in Afghanistan. The Ministry of Commerce has proposed to address some of the US concerns about data protection bill, business climate for digital trade and other trade-related issues. The Ministry of Information Technology has recommended to get access to the US markets for IT exports and investment of the US IT companies in the information technology sector.It also wants USAID scholarships in the information technology sector and new technologies. The Ministry of Energy has proposed to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US. Last month, the government signed a new longterm deal with Qatar for imports of additional LNG quantities. It also sought exploring possibility of US assistance in tapping PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s shale gas reserves. The energy ministry said that Pakistan could attract the US private sector investment in electricity transmission and distribution sectors and installation of automated metering infrastructure. Both the countries can collaborate in clean energy and converting waste to energy.The joint statement of the US-Pak Strategic Dialogue held in March 2016 reaffirmed the US-Pakistan energy cooperation ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ beginning imports of LNG and clean energy.

FPCCI urges govt to put industry on priority,2021-03-07,Business Recorder,"LAHORE: The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry has asked the government to put industry on priority for consistency in exports and a long-term economic growth, as the trade deficit has posted double-digit growth, widening by over 10% to $17.54 billion in the first eight months of 2020-21.Ã¢Â€ÂœThe economic managers were boasting of their performance on the plea of current account balance, which remained surplus till Oct 2020 on the back of a sustained increase in remittances and a smaller trade deficit. But now the trade gap has been widening since Dec 2020, as it has swollen by almost 24% to $2.52 billion in Feb 2021 mainly due to decline in exports and soaring imports,Ã¢Â€Â observed FPCCIÃ¢Â€Â™s ruling group BMP Chairman Mian Anjum Nisar. He was talking to a trade and industry delegation, who met him here in his office here Saturday. This is the second consecutive month that countryÃ¢Â€Â™s exports have been dropping from their previous levels, as the $2 billion worth of export receipts were the lowest in five months, he said and added that the exports had started picking up early this fiscal year and peaked to $2.4 billion in Dec, prompting jubilations by the government. Now this proved to be a short-term achievement, as the exports again started sliding towards a normal range of $2 billion, he added. Mian Anjum Nisar observed that countryÃ¢Â€Â™s exports have long remained around $2 billion a month and the trend did not significantly change despite 30% currency depreciation by this government during the past two and a half years. The Businessmen Panel (BMP) Chairman said the low exports volume and rising trade deficit were chronicle issues which should be resolved permanently. He said exportable items should be produced in accordance with the international demand to fully exploit the benefit of GSP-Plus status. He said that several industries and sectors were neglected in past. He said decisions should be made in national interest, keeping aside the personal agenda.Mian Anjum Nisar called for a holistic approach to speed up economic growth, as COVID-19 has adversely impacted the worldÃ¢Â€Â™s economy as well as PakistanÃ¢Â€Â™s trade and industrial sectors. Ã¢Â€ÂœWith a view to achieve consistency in current account surplus for a long period without compromising industrial growth the government will have to focus on increasing the exports and put the business and trade issues on priority, otherwise, the economic problems and balance of payment could further disturb with the growing trade deficit,Ã¢Â€Â said FPCCI ex-president.The increase in exports during previous months were due to temporary shifting of global trade from China towards South Asian countries and replenishing the dried inventories by the buyers in the US and Europe after the global economy gradually started recovering from the effects of Covid-19. Quoting the PBS, he said that on a month-on-month basis, the exports decreased by over 4.5% to $2.04 billion. As a result, the trade deficit further widened by 24% in Feb. He said the central bankÃ¢Â€Â™s data for the first seven months showed 3.8% decline in exports. Instead of resolving the issues, the government has been claiming huge success on the exports front through social media propaganda.The government has already missed the annual export target in its first two years. For the current fiscal year, it has set the export target at $22.7 billion, which will require 6.2% growth. This seems an uphill task now; given the fact that the little growth in exports has been disputed by the SBP while exports in the first half were equal to only 72% of the annual target.He said the government has to formulate long-term and consistent policies for the revival of industry and considerable improvement in exports, as contrary to regional countries, PakistanÃ¢Â€Â™s exports have remained stagnant during the past 40 years, and unless attention was paid to all factors that hamper industrial and exports growth, the country might not be able to achieve desired results. Some of the impediments to industrial growth include cost of production, poor governance, obsolete technology, lower productivity, lack of competitiveness, supply constraints, and energy issues. He said that the current export portfolio is marred by a lack of diversification, as few products are exported by some exporters to limited markets.

Farmers perturbed over sharp rise in fertiliser prices,2021-03-07,Tribune,"KARACHI:Farmers have voiced harsh criticism over the sharp rise in price of fertilisers and expressed concern that the hike would place additional burden on the already suffering agriculture sector.In a letter addressed to Minister for National Food Security Syed Fakhar Imam, officials from the Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB) remarked that a steep increase in prices of phosphorous and potash based fertilisers will aggravate troubles of the farmers.It pointed out that the price of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) jumped from Rs3,800 in December 2020 to Rs5,300 in March 2021. Similarly, cost of nitrophosphate fertiliser soared to Rs3,500 in March from Rs2,700 in December 2020.

He termed it essential for Pakistan to devise a policy to enhance crop yield and productivity across the country.A rise in input cost for growers will affect the cost of the final product, which means that the end consumer will suffer leading to difficulties for the government, said a former president of Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI).

Criticizing the opposition leadership, he mentioned the names of PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari and PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif, saying they were Ã¢Â€ÂœthievesÃ¢Â€Â who were blackmailing his government in order to get an Ã¢Â€ÂœNROÃ¢Â€Â. Ã¢Â€ÂœAll the dacoits who have been together and they believe by pressuring me they would get an Ã¢Â€ÂœNROÃ¢Â€Â...they say Aik Zardari Sab Pe Bhaari, it is because he is the most corrupt person and is being described in the world as Ã¢Â€ÂœMr 10 percentÃ¢Â€Â because of his corrupt practices,Ã¢Â€Â he remarked.   He further maintained that Nawaz Sharif had Ã¢Â€ÂœfakedÃ¢Â€Â his sickness to go abroad so that he could avoid the legal consequences of his Ã¢Â€Âœcorruption and theftÃ¢Â€Â.The prime minister also accused the opposition of linking the passage of FATF-related legislation with amendments in the NAB laws in a total Ã¢Â€ÂœdisregardÃ¢Â€Â to the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s interest, adding that they had put the country at stake to get rid of corruption cases against them.He also maintained that the Ã¢Â€Âœeconomy is on the path of recovery and the current account is improving constantly and now even the rupee is strengthening against the dollar without governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s [State Bank of PakistanÃ¢Â€Â™s] intervention.Ã¢Â€Â™ The Prime Minister said the biggest pressure he was facing was to tackle the issue of inflation, which he said was a natural result of the rupee slide. Ã¢Â€ÂœMy team or my government is doing everything it can to control inflation and we will keep working on it,Ã¢Â€Â he said, adding that he is aware that it is hard for the salaried class to meet their expenses.Another challenge, he added, was the electricity tariff which according to him was due to the expensive contracts sings by the previous government. Ã¢Â€ÂœBut weÃ¢Â€Â™re trying to find a way to lesson the burden on people,Ã¢Â€Â he added.The Prime Minister further said that his government signed an LNG contract at 30 percent low rates as compared to the one signed by the previous government.

Why Pakistan needs to have a clear definition of terrorism,2021-03-07,Dawn,"THE Financial Action Task Force has announced that Pakistan would remain on its grey list for further monitoring for another four months. In this period, the country will have to improve its financial transaction mechanisms so that these are not misused by terrorists and criminals. Apart from other measures related to effective investigation and prosecution, and the implementation of eventual sanctions, Pakistan would also have to make more laws in order to comply with the mutually agreed action plan.Pakistan amended or made almost three dozen laws during the past year to meet the FATF requirements. All these changes and new laws were essential to bring Pakistan out of the FATFÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s grey list in order to dispel the negative impression about the countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½soft stanceÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ towards certain militant groups. More than a year ago, the Supreme Court had also recommended that parliament develop a new and comprehensive leve consequences, the government did not take it seriously despite the fact that a clear definition of terrorism would have not only brought clarity to counterterrorism functions but would also have improved the governmentÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s performance in implementing FATF-related measures.The term Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½terrorismÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ is still defined in a vague and contradictory manner.The legal community and law-enforcement agencies have been demanding an amendment to the definition provided in Section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997, but the state has been reluctant to touch it. Ironically, the persisting, decades-long challenges of religiously motivated terrorism and violent extremism have failed to Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½influenceÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ the policymakers for that.In its judgement, the Supreme Court had observed that the definition provided in Section 6 of ATA 1997 had failed to capture the essence of terrorism and had often been misused fr policy lexicon, the term Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½terrorismÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ is still defined in a vague and contradictory manner, to the extent that it is not fully clear what Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½terrorismÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ is and what distinguishes it from other forms of political violence.Since its inception in 1947, the country has encountered several waves of political agitation and violent movements, which have been ethnic, linguistic, sub-national, communal and religious in nature. Violent religious, political and ethnonational movements continued posing security threats throughout the countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s history. Violent protests against religious communities, especially the campaign against the Ahmadi community in Punjab in 1953, insurgencies in Balochistan, ethnic and linguistic-based violence in Karachi, low-scale ethnonational violent agitations in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and sectarian conflict in Gilgit-Baltistan shaped the security approach of rned violent time and again, posed a more complex security challenge for the state. Despite facing all these challenges, it took Pakistan 50 years to define terrorism in 1997, and even so, the ambiguities still surrounding the definition forced the Supreme Court to weigh in. All through the various legal measures that Pakistan has taken to deal with terrorism-related security challenges, the legal definition of terrorism has remained vague. It is far from being comprehensive and criminalises expressions of sectarian hatred and certain violent political acts, which are already listed as punishable offences under the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).Pakistan does not have any official definition of extremism either and usually, extreme actions of religious hatred come under the PPC or ATA domain. Violence is an integral part of terrorism, militancy or insurgency, whereas extremism may employ persuasion manoeuvres to draw advantage. For example, the banned sectarian outfit Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan has consistently claimed to be a non-violent movement, but its leaders have often indulged in inciting violence against another sect and yet got legal relief by not being found directly engaged in perpetuating violent acts.Nationalist insurgents and religious militants use terrorism as a tactic to create chaos, disorder, fear and to undermine the stateÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s authority. They also employ other tactics to attract people and expand their support base, including via provision of social services for locals, offering alternative delivery systems, such as maintaining law and order and setting up informal courts as the Taliban did in Afghanistan and the UNSC-designated terrorist group Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) did in Pakistani tribal areas.They also run their propaganda campaigns, and their activities other than violent actions have similar objectives, but can these too be described as terrorism? Section 6 (5) of the ATA does say that any act undertaken for the benefit of a proscribed organisation amounts to te spokesperson Ehsanullah Ehsan surrendered to the security forces in 2017, he claimed amnesty on the ground that he had never been part of the TTPÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s terrorist operations, rather his task was confined to running its media affairs. Hence the question: who is a terrorist? Are terrorists only combatant units or non-combatants as well? And does every action of a terrorist, even if non-violent, automatically and always amount to terrorism?The confusion deepens when one tries to distinguish between terrorism and terrorists. Before his eventual indictment in a terrorism-financing case, the legal advisers of Jamaatud Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed had pleaded in court that he had never been found involved in any terrorist activity in Pakistan and he did get relief from the courts every time. There have been many other examples of this sort.In a nutshell, parliament has to develop a clear definition of terrorism. Causing fear, violence, the deliberate nature of the act, targeting of civilians, disturbal and global order, issuing threats (all this by non-state actors) are some common vital elements in every definition of terrorism. However, all these expressions need to be defined as well. The task is not beyond the capacity of parliament and it can restrict the meaning of terrorism within the jurisdiction of the crime and political/ideological motives, and avoid broad interpretations and political misuse.

Economic reforms Ã¢Â€Â“ bumpy road ahead,2021-03-07,Business Recorder,"Senate elections was the time when economic commentators were anticipating a change of tide in favour of PTI-led and ruling coalition, in terms of making legislations that are an imperative for the much-needed structural reforms and fulfilling IMF conditions. Now, purely on numbers the ruling party does not have a majority in the upper house and if the chairmanship goes to the opposition, treasury benches will not be in the driving seat in the Senate.    The PTI government remains on a weak ground in the backdrop of last weekÃ¢Â€Â™s events, although the prime minister has called oppositionÃ¢Â€Â™s bluff by seeking a vote of confidence successfully. But will it be enough to offset the psychological damage caused by the loss in the senate. The next step is senate chairmanship. If PTI and allies secure it, the government shall be back on a strong footing; or else, the hardship may persist.  The IMF programme has hung in the balance since the start of 2020. Requisite legislation and measures related to energy sector, public sector entities, and taxation have remained pending for a long time that hindered completion of IMF review. Now, with staff level mission completed, some required legislations probably will lead to IMF board approval. For example, the Nepra Act is pending with the national assemblyÃ¢Â€Â™s standing committee. This is a past condition, and perhaps, it needs to be passed before getting the nod of FundÃ¢Â€Â™s board. Then, there are pending amendments in the SBP Act and SOE laws. All these are prior actions to move forward. Back channel discussions with the IMF continued throughout Covid-19 and since Nov 2020, Ã¢Â€Â˜Q-BlockÃ¢Â€Â™ and SBP are of the view that good news is around the corner with respect to resumption of IMF programme. With staff level agreement taking place in Feb 2021, the perception is that the board approval would come right after the senate elections. The reason was that with the expected simple majority for PTI in the Senate along with its chairmanship, the roadmap for legislative reforms would smoothen. Now that is in limbo. It could have repercussions on the IMF programme.However, this does not mean that the government cannot get any legislation done. For that to happen, it needs simple majority in both houses Ã¢Â€Â“ it has razor thin majority in the lower house, and a little short in the upper house. But PTI and alliesÃ¢Â€Â™ numbers are in a better position now than prior to the elections. Simple majority means the majority within the members present and voting. This implies that in cases where opposition (PDM) is not keen to push the government back, the government may get the numbers needed in the upper house. Even if the government is unable to get it passed from the upper house - this can happen in a joint session Ã¢Â€Â“ where the PTI and allies now have simple majority.    Theoretically and technically, the government has now more power to legislate versus what the case was prior to the senate elections. But the situation is not as good as it was hoped. Even prior to the elections, there were incident where legislation was possible, such as passing of few bills related to FATF. PTI government was vulnerable and had to give in to others (both opposition and allies) for passing of any bill; that hasnÃ¢Â€Â™t changed much now either. The difference is, that now the allies and disgruntled members of PTI have received the message that the opposition has teeth to dent the government Ã¢Â€Â“ manifested by GilaniÃ¢Â€Â™s win in Islamabad. That will bring a much-weakened PTI on to the negotiation table. That will give maneuvering room to government allies such as PML-Q and MQM, who have now smelled the blood. That is politics. In terms of economics and governance, the tough times are not over. The PM and the government received a lucky break in the form of pandemic. The tough IMF conditions were relaxed. Increase in energy tariffs was postponed. Interest rates were almost halved. Oil prices went south, easing the import bill. Low travel resulted in current account surplus despite economic recovery. Now, the commodity prices are sharply heading north in anticipation of world travel opening up. This, with economic recovery, shall result in higher import numbers. Soon, monthly imports could be north of $5 billion. The bonanza of upbeat growth in home remittances may slow down with increase in travel. Inflation is again showing signs of resurgence. Food price administration failure continues. The pressure from IMF could build on, forcing the government to pass on impact of high oil prices to consumers in the shape of increase in petrol and diesel prices. Gas prices require massive adjustment too. The corporate tax exemptions may come to an end. SOEsÃ¢Â€Â™ expenditure shall be rationalized, leading to layoffs. Furthermore, there are signs of hike in interest rates (hopefully by not much) sometime in this calendar year.  These are tough decisions. It is hard to implement reforms given the high political temperature. But they are imperative for continuation of the IMF programme and to instill structural reforms. But the political capital has eroded and continues to erode. However, if the government wins the Senate chairmanship (one way or the other), it may succeed in partly salvaging the situation, otherwise it would be a bumpy road ahead.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021","economic reforms bumpy road ahead senate elections was the time when economic commentators were anticipating a change of tide in favour of PTI-led and ruling coalition, in terms of making legislations that are an imperative for the much-needed structural reforms and fulfilling IMF conditions. now, purely on numbers the ruling party does not have a majority in the upper house and if the chairmanship goes to the opposition, treasury benches will not be in the driving seat in the senate. the PTI government remains on a weak ground in the backdrop of last weeks events, although the prime minister has called oppositions bluff by seeking a vote of confidence successfully. but will it be enough to offset the psychological damage caused by the loss in the senate. the next step is senate chairmanship. if PTI and allies secure it, the government shall be back on a strong footing or else, the hardship may persist. the IMF programme has hung in the balance since the start of 2020. requisite legislation and measures related to energy sector, public sector entities, and taxation have remained pending for a long time that hindered completion of IMF review. now, with staff level mission completed, some required legislations probably will lead to IMF board approval. for example, the nepra act is pending with the national assemblys standing committee. this is a past condition, and perhaps, it needs to be passed before getting the nod of funds board. then, there are pending amendments in the SBP act and SOE laws. all these are prior actions to move forward. back channel discussions with the IMF continued throughout Covid-19 and since nov 2020, Q-Block and SBP are of the view that good news is around the corner with respect to resumption of IMF programme. with staff level agreement taking place in feb 2021, the perception is that the board approval would come right after the senate elections. the reason was that with the expected simple majority for PTI in the senate along with its chairmanship, the roadmap for legislative reforms would smoothen. now that is in limbo. it could have repercussions on the IMF programme.however, this does not mean that the government cannot get any legislation done. for that to happen, it needs simple majority in both houses it has razor thin majority in the lower house, and a little short in the upper house. but PTI and allies numbers are in a better position now than prior to the elections. simple majority means the majority within the members present and voting. this implies that in cases where opposition (PDM) is not keen to push the government back, the government may get the numbers needed in the upper house. even if the government is unable to get it passed from the upper house - this can happen in a joint session where the PTI and allies now have simple majority. theoretically and technically, the government has now more power to legislate versus what the case was prior to the senate elections. but the situation is not as good as it was hoped. even prior to the elections, there were incident where legislation was possible, such as passing of few bills related to FATF. PTI government was vulnerable and had to give in to others (both opposition and allies) for passing of any bill that hasnt changed much now either. the difference is, that now the allies and disgruntled members of PTI have received the message that the opposition has teeth to dent the government manifested by gilanis win in islamabad. that will bring a much-weakened PTI on to the negotiation table. that will give maneuvering room to government allies such as PML-Q and MQM, who have now smelled the blood. that is politics. in terms of economics and governance, the tough times are not over. the PM and the government received a lucky break in the form of pandemic. the tough IMF conditions were relaxed. increase in energy tariffs was postponed. interest rates were almost halved. oil prices went south, easing the import bill. low travel resulted in current account surplus despite economic recovery. now, the commodity prices are sharply heading north in anticipation of world travel opening up. this, with economic recovery, shall result in higher import numbers. soon, monthly imports could be north of $5 billion. the bonanza of upbeat growth in home remittances may slow down with increase in travel. inflation is again showing signs of resurgence. food price administration failure continues. the pressure from IMF could build on, forcing the government to pass on impact of high oil prices to consumers in the shape of increase in petrol and diesel prices. gas prices require massive adjustment too. the corporate tax exemptions may come to an end. SOEs expenditure shall be rationalized, leading to layoffs. furthermore, there are signs of hike in interest rates (hopefully by not much) sometime in this calendar year. these are tough decisions. it is hard to implement reforms given the high political temperature. but they are imperative for continuation of the IMF programme and to instill structural reforms. but the political capital has eroded and continues to erode. however, if the government wins the senate chairmanship (one way or the other), it may succeed in partly salvaging the situation, otherwise it would be a bumpy road ahead."

Masses support PTI in struggle to uphold democratic norms: Shibli,2021-03-07,Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: Minister for Information and Broadcasting Senator Shibli Faraz on Sunday said Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI) believed in democratic norms and fighting for upholding the democratic principles as well as ethical values.People acknowledge endeavours of the incumbent government and supported Prime Minister Imran Khan in this struggle, the minister said while addressing a press conference here.He said Prime Minister Imran Khan believed in the politics of principles and decided to get a fresh vote of confidence though legally there was no need for it. The National Assembly reposed confidence in the leadership of Prime Minister Imran khan with even more votes than the 2018, he stated.Senator Shibli Faraz said a wave of jubilance and celebration was witnessed not only inside Pakistan but also thousands of felicitation messages were received from abroad after he secured  the trust vote.Shibli Faraz said Imran KhanÃ¢Â€Â™s victory in the vote of confidence has given a new spirit to people who understood that the designs of dark forces were defeated. The minister said opposition parties especially the Pakistan Democratic Movement believed in politics of self-interest, bullying and sale and purchase of loyalties and they had damaged the entire social, economic and political system during the past four decades. He said some of the opposition leaders entered into politics in 1985 party-less elections and introduced the culture of bribery and  horse trading to come to power.Shibli Faraz said due to the political approach of the past rulers the country faced severe challenges which added in the sufferings of masses whereas they plundered national wealth and built properties not only inside Pakistan but in Europe and other parts of the world. They turned politics into business and used it for self-interest and not for the interest of country, said the minister.He said the PTI has gradually emerged on the political horizon of the country and in the 2013 election it formed government in KPK, adding that due to its good performance people showed their confidence on it and PTI came into power in 2018 with masses' support.Now after the Senate election it has become the single largest party in both the National Assembly and Senate having representation in all four provinces as people have supported its ideology of ending the status quo. He said in last general elections people rejected the politics of self-interest and the Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League -Nawaz have been confined to only one province each.He said the narrative of opposition parties has been changed with the situation and if they won the elections, they term it as free and fair elections. In the case of defeat, they started hue and cry by alleging of rigged elections. The information minister vowed to continue to struggle against the elements which socially, economically and democratically damaged the country.He said the PDM candidate won the Senate elections from Islamabad not on merit but through unfair means for which they did not deserve any credit. He said they want to come to power to restart the ugly business of loot and plunder and wanted to get relief in corruption cases but they would not get it  as Prime Minister Imran Khan was a bold and upright person who would not make any compromise on principles.He said  Imran Khan entered in politics not for the sake of power but for serving the nation. He said the PTI government took practical steps for bringing transparency in the electoral system so that people could be elected on merit and not through use of ill-gotten money.On the economic front, Shibli Faraz said the it has been stabilized and its benefits  would reach to poor soon. He said Prime Minister was giving special emphasis to check inflation and control prices of daily use commodities. He said targeted subsidy would be given to people on essential items including the power tariff, adding that universal insurance has been given to the entire population of the KPK through Insaf Sehat card and the same would be replicated in Punjab.Moreover, the dream of owning a personal home of the poor would be materialized under the new housing scheme launched by PTI.Replying to queries of media he said Sadiq Sanjrani has been named as the PTI  and its allied parties' candidate for Chairman Senate as the ruling alliance wanted to give Balochistan representation.

Karachi: reliable power provision,2021-03-07,Business Recorder,"Karachi, the largest metropolis of Pakistan is a city of contrasts. It boasts some of the tallest skyscrapers and largest industrial zones in the country, and simultaneously more than a third of the city comprises unplanned settlements. Providing utility services safely and reliably to such areas remains a serious challenge. Often, residents of these areas are economically vulnerable, with low propensity to pay resulting in rampant utility theft and default. This compounded by unfettered encroachments, weak law enforcement and fragmented governance creates unique hurdles for utility operators.KEÃ¢Â€Â™s connection with Karachi is over 107 years old and extends beyond mere power provision. As an integral part of this vital and resilient city, we remain committed to serving it and uplifting it. As a company, whose very existence depends on this city thriving and as a resident of this city, I am convinced that our strength is linked with the progress of KarachiÃ¢Â€Â™s communities and social and civil infrastructure upgradation must go hand in hand to surmount obstacles to power delivery, particularly in under-served areas. This model has worked in areas such as Korangi Ã¢Â€Â“ which is home to over one million people. Many parts of Korangi experienced up to seven hours of load-shedding on a daily basis on account of power theft which hampered industrial activities thus affecting employment growth and socio-economic decline. Through community engagement, upgrades to the power infrastructure of the area and CSR efforts, K-Electric was able to address the factors that perpetuated power theft, bringing load-shed duration down by four hours with the intent to zeroize it. In just Korangi, these efforts protected over 5,000 jobs in over 500 cottage industries benefitting entire families.We were able to replicate this effort in other high-loss areas of Karachi, located in Baldia, Orangi, Surjani, Gadap, Malir, Landhi, Lyari, Nazimabad, Korangi and Liaquatabad which comprise roughly two thirds of the cityÃ¢Â€Â™s population and consume one third of the total electricity. Under our Sarbulandi initiative, KE has committed PKR 10 billion in areas which experience load-shed due to power theft to rehabilitate and upgrade power infrastructure, install theft-resistant Aerial Bundled Cable (ABC) and create community spaces in just three years. These aggressive investments in the cityÃ¢Â€Â™s most vulnerable communities are part of KEÃ¢Â€Â™s vision to make Karachi load-shed free by converting bare conductors to ABC, improving network health and safety equipment, eliminating illegal hooks strengthening governance.Provision of electricity, however, is just one element of what is required in these areas which are deprived of basic necessities such as clean drinking water, access to basic health care and education. Considering the diversity and uniqueness of KarachiÃ¢Â€Â™s communities, a one-size-fits-all solution would have proven ineffective. Targeted strategies in line with ground realities for each area developed and executed in partnership with community representatives ensured win-win results. Load-shed hours in six very high loss (VHL) areas were reduced by over four hours, 50 feeders were shifted to a lower loss category and more than 10,000 PMTs were converted to ABC alongside metering of over 100,000 customers. Till date, we have benefitted over eight million people, across 400 communities through improved access to power, provision of clean drinking water, free medical treatments and commitments to hire for over 800 different positions from areas where this initiative is under way.It has not been an easy journey with no-go areas, encroachments, and the struggle to get required permissions from various regulatory bodies and agencies that are involved in administering Karachi. And all of this would not be possible without KEÃ¢Â€Â™s dedicated field teams. They often work in unfriendly environments, come hell or high water, even wading through two feet of water or carrying ladders and other heavy equipment on their shoulders through the narrow lanes of katchi abadis and goths that increasingly make up KarachiÃ¢Â€Â™s landscape. Urban planners stress that KarachiÃ¢Â€Â™s communities as a whole can only evolve when public and private stakeholders work together for their betterment. Under our recently announced KHI Awards initiative we have extended our hands to work with many other social investment entities who are equally committed to working for Karachi, with the faith that working together synergistically, we will benefit Karachi even further.

"Promotion, better terms & conditions or reinstatement: Civil servantÃ¢Â€Â™s claim is Ã¢Â€Â˜survivable claimÃ¢Â€Â™: SC",2021-03-07,Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Saturday ruled that a claim by a civil servant for his promotion, better terms and conditions or for reinstatement in service is survivable claim and passes on in the shape of pecuniary and pensionary benefits to his legal heirs.Such a claim may arise under the service laws but also enjoys constitutional underpinning, therefore such right does not abate upon his death, said the court.The question before the apex court was whether the appeal filed by a civil servant in the Federal Service Tribunal (Ã¢Â€ÂœTribunalÃ¢Â€Â) would abate on his death or his legal heirs could pursue the same.A three-member bench headed by Justice Manzoor Ahmad Malik comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan had heard the appeal of Regional Operation Chief, National Bank of Pakistan, Sargodha against the order of Federal Service Tribunal dated 14.09.2015.Rana Ejaz Ahmad, a grade III officer, was departmentally proceeded against by the petitioners and was awarded major penalty of reduction to a lower stage of pay by three steps. The decedent challenged the imposition of penalty but died during pendency of his appeal before the tribunal.The tribunal allowing the legal heirs of the decedent to be impleaded as a party to the appeal pending before it on 14-09-2015 rejected the objection of the petitioners that the claim of the decedent did not survive after his death. The petitioners had pleaded before the apex court that no remedy has been provided to the legal heirs of a civil servant under the Service Tribunals Act, 1973 and, therefore, the respondents could not be permitted to pursue the claim initiated by the decedent.The judgement authored by Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, said: Ã¢Â€ÂœUnder our constitutional scheme, abatement of proceedings on the death of a civil servant, in a case, where the cause of action carries a survivable interest will unduly deprive the decedent civil servant, as well as, his legal heirs of their constitutional rights to livelihood, property, dignity and fair trial.Ã¢Â€ÂThe court noted that the apex court in the Chief Secretary Punjab vs Chaudhry Iftikhar Ahmad case held that peculiar benefits to which the legal heirs would become entitled would not allow the Ã¢Â€ÂœlisÃ¢Â€Â to abate on the death of a civil servant.The court noted that the decedent in addition to assailing penalty imposed on him was seeking payment of wages which would have been due had he not been punished in departmental proceedings. It said if the departmental decision is overturned in appeal, the heirs of the decedent would at least inherit back benefits which their predecessor would have got, had he succeeded in appeal in his lifetime. It is noteworthy that the heirsÃ¢Â€Â™ entitlement to service benefits may sometimes transcend usual gains like pension, gratuity, etc. The respondents in the instant petition would receive some benefits in case they are able to vindicate their stand before the Tribunal. Such a claim does not extinguish with the death of civil servant. Letting the claim lapse on the basis of an ultra textualist interpretation of the Act would be denying the heirs the right to seek adjudication on merits. The tribunal is deemed to be a civil court for the purpose of deciding an appeal and has the same powers as are vested in such court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (Ã¢Â€ÂœCPCÃ¢Â€Â).19 Rule 33 of Order XLI of CPC empowers a Court of Appeal to pass any decree, said the judgement.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021","promotion, better terms & conditions or reinstatement civil servants claim is survivable claim SC ISLAMABAD the supreme court on saturday ruled that a claim by a civil servant for his promotion, better terms and conditions or for reinstatement in service is survivable claim and passes on in the shape of pecuniary and pensionary benefits to his legal heirs.such a claim may arise under the service laws but also enjoys constitutional underpinning, therefore such right does not abate upon his death, said the court.the question before the apex court was whether the appeal filed by a civil servant in the federal service tribunal (Tribunal) would abate on his death or his legal heirs could pursue the same.a three-member bench headed by justice manzoor ahmad malik comprising justice syed mansoor ali shah and justice Amin-ud-Din khan had heard the appeal of regional operation chief, national bank of pakistan, sargodha against the order of federal service tribunal dated 14.09.2015.rana ejaz ahmad, a grade III officer, was departmentally proceeded against by the petitioners and was awarded major penalty of reduction to a lower stage of pay by three steps. the decedent challenged the imposition of penalty but died during pendency of his appeal before the tribunal.the tribunal allowing the legal heirs of the decedent to be impleaded as a party to the appeal pending before it on 14-09-2015 rejected the objection of the petitioners that the claim of the decedent did not survive after his death. the petitioners had pleaded before the apex court that no remedy has been provided to the legal heirs of a civil servant under the service tribunals act, 1973 and, therefore, the respondents could not be permitted to pursue the claim initiated by the decedent.the judgement authored by justice mansoor ali shah, said under our constitutional scheme, abatement of proceedings on the death of a civil servant, in a case, where the cause of action carries a survivable interest will unduly deprive the decedent civil servant, as well as, his legal heirs of their constitutional rights to livelihood, property, dignity and fair trial.the court noted that the apex court in the chief secretary punjab vs chaudhry iftikhar ahmad case held that peculiar benefits to which the legal heirs would become entitled would not allow the lis to abate on the death of a civil servant.the court noted that the decedent in addition to assailing penalty imposed on him was seeking payment of wages which would have been due had he not been punished in departmental proceedings. it said if the departmental decision is overturned in appeal, the heirs of the decedent would at least inherit back benefits which their predecessor would have got, had he succeeded in appeal in his lifetime. it is noteworthy that the heirs entitlement to service benefits may sometimes transcend usual gains like pension, gratuity, etc. the respondents in the instant petition would receive some benefits in case they are able to vindicate their stand before the tribunal. such a claim does not extinguish with the death of civil servant. letting the claim lapse on the basis of an ultra textualist interpretation of the act would be denying the heirs the right to seek adjudication on merits. the tribunal is deemed to be a civil court for the purpose of deciding an appeal and has the same powers as are vested in such court under the code of civil procedure, 1908 (CPC).19 rule 33 of order XLI of CPC empowers a court of appeal to pass any decree, said the judgement."

SOEs continue bleeding money,2021-03-08,Dawn,"In yet another step towards the formal revival of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme, the government is set to introduce in parliament a fresh bill for the restructuring, liquidation and privatisation of state-owned entities (SOEs). The government has finalised the draft SOE Bill with the close coordination of the IMF, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank to ensure better management of the SOE portfolio.As part of the process, the government last week finalised a triage of 84 out of a total of 212 SOEs that would be prepared in the first phase of restructuring for ultimate privatisation, liquidation or retention in the public sector to meet a structural benchmark of the IMF.The overall revenues of all these 84 SOEs in 2018-19 amounted to about Rs4 trillion while the book value of their assets stood at Rs19tr. The revenues in 2018-19 were roughly 10 per cent of nominal GDP, providing employment to more than 450,000 people (0.8pc of the total workforce), according to the Ministry of Finance.The government plans to retain its ownership in 14 entities. However, these require immediate reforms and possible restructuringThe proposed law will introduce structured governance reforms in the management and oversight of the SOEs. Through this proposed legislation, the boards of directors of the SOEs will be given more autonomy in terms of decision-making in addition to ensuring the separation of the office of chairman from that of the CEO in all SOEs, including entities established through special enactments. Moreover, the role of the line ministries and divisions will be streamlined for operational autonomy of the SOEs.Even before the legislation, the Ministry of Finance has initiated steps for the establishment of a Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) within the Ministry of Finance, which will function as the central database and analytical unit for all the SOEs and will report directly to the federal government through the finance minister. The unit will be staffed with experts to be hired from the market and necessary resources for its working will be provided. The CMU will have access to necessary financial and non-financial information of each SOE and the business plans and target performance outcomes. The unit will prepare periodical performance evaluation reports of the SOEs and assist the federal government on matters of critical importance for better management of SOEs and their improved performance.The Ministry of Finance has already started working on an SOE Ownership and Management Policy with technical support from the ADB and the IMF. So far, no policy framework exists in Pakistan that covers the entire SOE portfolio. This appears to be a departure from the previous concept of an umbrella organisation (Sarmaya Pakistan) given the fact the various SOEs had their peculiar challenges and solutions and could not be addressed through a one-size-fits-all solution.To address the current policy gap and the diversity of sectors and legal and institutional frameworks in which the SOEs operate, the government now intends to develop a policy to manage these SOEs through a coherent and institutionalised arrangement. The clarity on the ownership rationale of SOEs, the role of the federal government as shareholder and the manner of the exercise of the ownership function, the respective roles and responsibilities of the federal government, line ministries and the boards of SOEs, frameworks of competitive neutrality and public-sector obligation, and necessary reporting and decision-making processes will be important components of the proposed policy.There are 14 entities that are planned to be retained under government ownership but require immediate reforms and possible restructuring. Among them are Pakistan Railways and Pakistan InterÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½national Airlines, which were collectively making a loss of Rs88 billion in FY2018-19. They are already under an active restructuring and reform process.The finance ministry said these were not performing core functions as covered in the Public Policy Framework are recommended for privatisation or liquidation. There are 10 SOEs, which are already on an active privatisation list and are at various stages of the privatisation process. About 34 more entities will be gradually added to the list but none of them may reach the sale counter during the term of the current government and may be ready by June 2023 to 2025.Pakistan Steel Mills is an important entity on the active list and is at an advanced stage of the privatisation process. SME Bank is another loss-making SOE, which is on the active privatisation list. In addition to these, partial divestment of Oil and Gas Development Company and Pakistan Petroleum is also underway.The Ministry of Finance has reported to the cabinet and the IMF that a total of 25 SOEs, which earned cumulative profits of Rs107bn in 2018-19, would be retained by the government for supplying goods and services, serving national or economic interest, set up under G2G arrangement, essential infrastructure services requiring large investments, national food security, national defence or security etc.Another 14 companies are also retained in the public sector and will be restructured. There are about 10 other companies that have been described as potential candidates for privatisation while one entity Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ Industrial Development Bank Limited Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ is currently under liquidation.The ministry said that four companies having total profitability of Rs51.4bn in 2018-19 were financially viable and would be retained in government hands. These include Government Holding Ltd (Rs34bn profit), Pak Arab Refinery (Rs12.3bn), Pak-Kuwait Investment (Rs4.7bn) and Pakistan Revenue Automation (Rs146 million).The ministry said that despite their important role in providing essential public goods and services, the financial performance of several SOEs had remained unsatisfactory. In 2018-19, these 84 commercial SOEs collectively recorded net losses of Rs143bn, down from Rs287bn in 2017-18. The improvement in SOEs performance wat business growth in local upstream oil and gas markets translating into significant gains for oil and gas companies, and policy reforms and operational improvements in the power sector leading to timely tariff notifications.Over the past six years, one-third of the commercial SOEs experienced losses intermittently. Moreover, the sum of the losses of top-10 loss-making SOEs contributed around 90pc to the total losses of SOE portfolio each year.

SME bank is another loss-making SOE, which is on the active privatisation list. in addition to these, partial divestment of oil and gas development company and pakistan petroleum is also underway.the ministry of finance has reported to the cabinet and the IMF that a total of 25 SOEs, which earned cumulative profits of rs 107bn in 2018-19, would be retained by the government for supplying goods and services, serving national or economic interest, set up under G2G arrangement, essential infrastructure services requiring large investments, national food security, national defence or security etc.another 14 companies are also retained in the public sector and will be restructured. there are about 10 other companies that have been described as potential candidates for privatisation while one entity industrial development bank limited is currently under liquidation.the ministry said that four companies having total profitability of rs 51.4bn in 2018-19 were financially viable and would be retained in government hands. these include government holding ltd (Rs 34bn profit), pak arab refinery (Rs 12.3bn), Pak-Kuwait investment (Rs 4.7bn) and pakistan revenue automation (Rs 146 million).the ministry said that despite their important role in providing essential public goods and services, the financial performance of several SOEs had remained unsatisfactory. in 2018-19, these 84 commercial SOEs collectively recorded net losses of rs 143bn, down from rs 287bn in 2017-18. the improvement in SOEs performance wat business growth in local upstream oil and gas markets translating into significant gains for oil and gas companies, and policy reforms and operational improvements in the power sector leading to timely tariff notifications.over the past six years, one-third of the commercial SOEs experienced losses intermittently. moreover, the sum of the losses of top-10 loss-making SOEs contributed around 90pc to the total losses of SOE portfolio each year. national highways authority, pakistan railways, PIA and power-sector distribution companies had been among the top 10 loss-making SOEs.Among the SOEs performing core functions, 25 SOEs were profitable in 2018-19. another 19 entities had been consistently profit-making during the last three years 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 however, their returns on assets had been lower than the threshold. two more SOEs central powawn, the business and finance weekly, , march 8th, 2021"

Need to overhaul agricultural finance regime,2021-03-08,Dawn,"In Pakistan, 90-94 per cent of farm loans are offered for production and only 6-10pc for agricultural development. According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the share of development loans in total agricultural finance stood at 6pc in 2018-19. This percentage improved to 6.7pc in 2019-20 and further to 10pc in the first seven months of this fiscal year.Among other things, this factor is also responsible for keeping our agriculture where it is today Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ under-exploited, low on productivity, high on wastages, slow-progressing and least prepared for future challenges. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½The development and commercialisation of agriculture requires financial services that can support: larger agriculture investments and agriculture-related infrastructure that require long-term funding, a greater inclusion of youth and women in agriculture and advancements in technology.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ This statement coming from the World Bank in October 2020 sums up, to a great extenuntries. Pakistan is no exception. On its part, the country has long been making efforts to restructure its agricultural finance regime. And, one can find some examples of these ongoing efforts in the introduction of measures like warehouse receipt financing and greater involvement of microfinance institutions in agricultural lending.The SBP should consider assigning sub-targets for agricultural development loans to banks Last year, the SBP had come up with a detailed report on agri financing. In that report, it had defined development agri finance as medium- and long-term loans that banks offer in all sub-sectors of agriculture i.e. major and minor crops, livestock, dairy, poultry, fisheries and forestry. Short-term loans of six months to one year are offered to the entire agriculture sector mostly for meeting their working capital needs. But medium- to long-term loans of three- to five-year maturity are advanced to enable agriculturists to undertake projects that can help improve productivity and cut wastages.That is why looking at the volumes of agricultural development lending is important to understand how much Pakistan agriculture is prepared to meet future challenges like national food security and environmental protection. Within agricultural development financing, farm sectorÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s development loans are mainly offered for improvement of farmland and orchards, construction of tunnel farms, storage sites and warehouses, installation of efficient irrigation systems and purchase of farming machinery. But no study has been conducted by the provinces to ascertain how development finance offered to crop growers in each province have resulted in better yields and low wastages. After all, agriculture is a provincial subject and in the absence of such studies one cannot expect banks or the central bank to overhaul agricultural development finance with a view to increasing crop yields and cut pre- and post-harvest losses. Banks just offer agricultural development finance as part of overall agrtheir lending remains demand-driven. It is up to growers to see the benefits of development finance and seek it from banks if they meet the eligibility criteria. For those in corporate farming, this makes sense. But leaving such crucial decision-making to small individual growers seems unwise.The SBP should consider assigning sub-targets of agricultural development loans to banks as a certain percentage of overall agricultural lending targets. The central bank may also push banks for greater agricultural development lending to small and medium-size individual growers as well. Sub-targets for agricultural development loans can also be set for banks for making agricultural loans in livestock, fisheries and poultry sub-sectors. And, banks should seek help from provincial governments in creating awareness among farmers Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ and devising a mechanism for aligning agricultural development loans with the overall national food security targets.In case of overall agricultural lending that includes well as development, distribution of loans still suffers from geographical discrepancies. If this issue is left unaddressed, it would produce undesired political fallouts besides hurting the objectives of national food security via sustainable high growth in agriculture. In continuation of a long-held trend, agricultural lending in July-December 2020 remained disproportionately high in Punjab and the smaller provinces got little. Out of Rs617bn worth of total agricultural loans, Punjab-based farmers got Rs517.6bn or 83.9pc, followed by Sindh that got Rs88.8bn or 14.4pc. Only 1.7pc of the total agri credit was distributed among farmers in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, latest data released by the SBP reveals.This pattern needs to be broken once and for all. SindhÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s contribution to PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s agriculture is close to 20pc and the collective contribution of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir altural loaning, particularly agricultural development loaning, cannot be linked to the exact contribution of a federating unit to the countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s total agriculture.

Under the umbrella of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Pakistan and China have signed several agreements for cooperation in the agricultural sector. The SBP-supervised agricultural credit scheme under which banks make agri loans to farmers must now encourage banks to roll out specific financing models for the projects that these agreements cover. The central bank should also revise the scheme in the near future to accommodate inputs from the smaller provinces. This is important as some of the planned agricultural projects under CPEC aim at improving the irrigation system across Py areas of planned cooperation under CPECÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s agricultural outreach programme.

A wide gender gap in capital market,2021-03-08,Tribune,"KARACHI:What comes to your mind when you think of the capital market and brokerage houses? Men sitting in front of computers and having intense discussion.You wouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t be entirely wrong. PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s capital market and brokerage firms are indeed male-dominated. But is this because women choose not to work in this field or because the sector isnÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™t very welcoming?When it comes to gender diversity, we all know that the capital market has started from a very low base. While the market has helped PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economy to grow, it also creates inequalities.Statistics back this up. Only 14% of staff at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) is female. This ratio gets somewhat better when we move up the ladder with 25% of the executive management team at the PSX comprising females.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThere is a glass ceiling for women in the capital market; male colleagues do not allow women to move forward,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â lamented PSXÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s former business development and communications head Anita Mirza.Mirza, who is also NBP Fullerton Asset ManagementÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s ex-head of business development, mentioned that women had to work extra hard to cross the barriers in order to make a place for themselves in the industry. Shedding light on reasons behind the low female representation, Mirza said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe main problem stems from the way women are raised throughout their lives.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœSince a very young age, societal values create pressure on them. They juggle between their families, children and work,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â she said, adding that men in their families channelised the talent of women towards domestic work.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœIt is not just about the capital market, gender bias and gender discrimination is common in most of the industries in Pakistan,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â stressed InfraZamin Pakistan Chief Executive Maheen Rahman.Identifying the reasons, specifically in the capital market, she said society pressurised women to pay attention to their families rather than focus on career opportunities due to which the market lost qualified women at junior levels. Hence, ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœwomen are rarely seen at leadership positions in the capital market.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂRahman was of the view that the major reason behind the lower number of female employees was the absence of a women-friendly environment.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThere are certain needs of females, which should be addressed at workplaces; women should be granted maternity leaves, they should be given equal opportunities when they resume work after a long gap.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂHowever, according to PSX CEO Farrukh H Khan, the stock exchange management focuses on the well-being of its female employees and provides equal opportunities.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœPSX has implemented all gender-related laws and policies pertaining to maternity benefits, harassment complaints, etc,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he emphasised.Talking about the Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Policy, the CEO said the comprehensive policy ensured equal opportunities for both men and women. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThis policy ensures consistent employment opportunities, succession planning and compensation for male and female employees alike.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂDiscussing the reasons behind the low female participation, Farrukh said women had not generally opted for a career in the capital market.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWe get the impression that women stay away from frontline fields like stock trading or dealing with stock investments,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said, adding, ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWomen are entering the fields of research, capital market structuring, fund management, investment banking and related areas but are not in areas such as stock trading.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂEndorsing his views, PSX Head of Marketing and Business Development Raeda Latif said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœI do not particularly think that the capital market is a tough place for women.

capital market KARACHI what comes to your mind when you think of the capital market and brokerage houses? men sitting in front of computers and having intense discussion.you wouldnt be entirely wrong. pakistans capital market and brokerage firms are indeed male-dominated. but is this because women choose not to work in this field or because the sector isnt very welcoming?when it comes to gender diversity, we all know that the capital market has started from a very low base. while the market has helped pakistans economy to grow, it also creates inequalities.statistics back this up. only 14% of staff at the pakistan stock exchange (PSX) is female. this ratio gets somewhat better when we move up the ladder with 25% of the executive management team at the PSX comprising females.there is a glass ceiling for women in the capital market male colleagues do not allow women to move forward, lamented PSXs former business development and communications head anita Mirza.Mirza, who is also NBP fullerton asset managements ex-head of business development, mentioned that women had to work extra hard to cross the barriers in order to make a place for themselves in the industry. shedding light on reasons behind the low female representation, mirza said, the main problem stems from the way women are raised throughout their lives.since a very young age, societal values create pressure on them. they juggle between their families, children and work, she said, adding that men in their families channelised the talent of women towards domestic work.it is not just about the capital market, gender bias and gender discrimination is common in most of the industries in pakistan, stressed InfraZamin pakistan chief executive maheen Rahman.Identifying the reasons, specifically in the capital market, she said society pressurised women to pay attention to their families rather than focus on career opportunities due to which the market lost qualified women at junior levels. hence, women are rarely seen at leadership positions in the capital market.rahman was of the view that the major reason behind the lower number of female employees was the absence of a women-friendly environment.there are certain needs of females, which should be addressed at workplaces women should be granted maternity leaves, they should be given equal opportunities when they resume work after a long gap.however, according to PSX CEO farrukh H khan, the stock exchange management focuses on the well-being of its female employees and provides equal opportunities.PSX has implemented all gender-related laws and policies pertaining to maternity benefits, harassment complaints, etc, he emphasised.talking about the diversity and inclusion (D&I) policy, the CEO said the comprehensive policy ensured equal opportunities for both men and women. this policy ensures consistent employment opportunities, succession planning and compensation for male and female employees alike.discussing the reasons behind the low female participation, farrukh said women had not generally opted for a career in the capital market.we get the impression that women stay away from frontline fields like stock trading or dealing with stock investments, he said, adding, women are entering the fields of research, capital market structuring, fund management, investment banking and related areas but are not in areas such as stock trading.endorsing his views, PSX head of marketing and business development raeda latif said, I do not particularly think that the capital market is a tough place for women. in fact, this is one area where women can excel.latif, who is among the four women in the executive management, said usually most women got education in fields other than STEM disciplines. similarly, in the capital market, women dont traditionally opt for a career and hence, we see more men than women in the market, she said.however, I feel this is now changing and more women are coming in this market as we see them in research, market structuring and related fields, latif said.i am happy to say that some women have even ventured into the trading side and I am hopeful that with the passage of time, this will become the norm and more women will be working side by side with men as traders or in other fields.talking about the presumed hurdles faced by women in rising to leadership positions, latif underlined that women did not face any such obstacles in the capital market.traditionally, more men than women have taken to working in this field, but now as more and more women are coming forth, this

"Trade deficit likely to remain wide in last 4 months of current fiscal year, say analysts",2021-03-08,Dawn,"PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s resurging trade deficit isnÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t surprising given the nationÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s heavy reliance on imports and the limited range of products it can sell to the world. This was expected to increase in the wake of new growth in import demand with the pick-up in economic activities and consumption. Few believed that the government and central bank could reduce the trade gap by holding down the import demand for a very long time to keep the pressure off the countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s current account.The new trade data published by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) shows that the February trade gap expanded by almost 24 per cent to $2.5 billion year-on-year, mainly owing to the rebounding imports and the falling exports, which luckily continued to grow by above $2bn for the fifth consecutive month. The gap, however, declined by about 5.9pc from January on a month-on-month basis.The data for the first eight months of the current fisctween July and February after the gap between what the country paid for its imports and what it earned through its exports swelled to $17.5bn from $15.8bn a year ago. This is in spite of the 4.3pc growth in exports to $16.3bn from $15.6bn a year ago. Trade deficit will likely remain wide in the last four months of the current fiscal year as imports will continue to post growth as the global economy reopens while domestic demand for food products, cotton and industrial machinery is expected to stay highImports, on the other hand, rose by 7.5pc to $33.8bn from $31.5bn.The continuous drop in imports on suppressed domestic demand helped by the declining global oil prices in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis had provided some breathing space to the central bank in managing external accounts despite stagnating exports. Last fiscal year, the countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s import bill shrank sharply by $10.3bn or 18.8pc to $44.5bn from $54.8bn in the previous year.However, the rebound in imports is likely to again external side in case the workersÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ remittances sent home by non-resident Pakistanis also start dropping going forward. Elaborating on the factors leading to import growth, commerce minister Abdul Razak Dawood tweeted that most of this growth had come from an increase of 7.8pc in the import of raw materials and intermediate goods (which is reflected by an increase in the manufacturing output in recent months) even though the imports of capital goods declined by 0.2pc. The imports of consumer goods also went down by 7.3pc.Besides raw materials and intermediary goods imported by the industry, the increased purchases of food products Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ especially wheat and sugar Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ this year owing to domestic shortages also increased. The rising cotton imports on the back of the failure of the domestic crop at a time when the textile and clothing industry is operating at its full capacity to meet the export orders also forced the import bill to go up. T stands at $1.95bn in the July to February period. In addition to them, the spike in the energy prices Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ too played its part in raising the dollar value of the import bill and consequently the trade deficit.Analysts agree that the trade deficit will likely remain wide in the remaining four months of the current fiscal year as imports will continue to post growth as the global economy reopens while the domestic demand for food products, cotton and industrial machinery is expected to stay high. Driven by food imports and domestic economic activity, imports are projected by the central bank to surpass their annual target of $42.4bn. According to the State Bank of Pakistan Governor Reza Baqir, the industry has already opened letters of credit worth $1bn for importing machinery for new projects or expansion and balancing, modernisation and replacement of the existing ones under the bankÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s concessionat the trade gap will continue to expand. However, he recently told Dawn that the increase in exports and remittances would offset the impact of the rising imports on the current account (for the time being at least). The banks have so far approved TERF loans of over Rs430bn or equal to 1pc of the GDP. The rising global oil prices and commodities like palm oil etc may further swell the import bill and, in turn, the trade gap.While imports are likely to rise, PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s overseas shipments are anticipated to decline in the next four months as its regional competitors Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ India and Bangladesh Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ reopen their economies and the textile and clothing importers from the US and Europe return to their old suppliers. However, the textile industry, which comprises almost 60pc of the nationÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s total export revenues, is confident of retaining a larger share of the new export orders despite reopening India and Bangladesh. The tryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s external sector.

The only sustainable way forward is to boost exports through expanding the product range, finding new markets, as well as attracting foreign direct investment in export industries by escalating work on the development of special economic zones with plug-and-play facilities. Published in Dawn, Th","trade deficit likely to remain wide in last 4 months of current fiscal year, say analysts pakistans resurging trade deficit isnt surprising given the nations heavy reliance on imports and the limited range of products it can sell to the world. this was expected to increase in the wake of new growth in import demand with the pick-up in economic activities and consumption. few believed that the government and central bank could reduce the trade gap by holding down the import demand for a very long time to keep the pressure off the countrys current account.the new trade data published by the pakistan bureau of statistics (PBS) shows that the february trade gap expanded by almost 24 per cent to $2.5 billion year-on-year, mainly owing to the rebounding imports and the falling exports, which luckily continued to grow by above $2bn for the fifth consecutive month. the gap, however, declined by about 5.9pc from january on a month-on-month basis.the data for the first eight months of the current fisctween july and february after the gap between what the country paid for its imports and what it earned through its exports swelled to $17.5bn from $15.8bn a year ago. this is in spite of the 4.3pc growth in exports to $16.3bn from $15.6bn a year ago. trade deficit will likely remain wide in the last four months of the current fiscal year as imports will continue to post growth as the global economy reopens while domestic demand for food products, cotton and industrial machinery is expected to stay highimports, on the other hand, rose by 7.5pc to $33.8bn from $31.5bn.the continuous drop in imports on suppressed domestic demand helped by the declining global oil prices in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis had provided some breathing space to the central bank in managing external accounts despite stagnating exports. last fiscal year, the countrys import bill shrank sharply by $10.3bn or 18.8pc to $44.5bn from $54.8bn in the previous year.however, the rebound in imports is likely to again external side in case the workers remittances sent home by non-resident pakistanis also start dropping going forward. elaborating on the factors leading to import growth, commerce minister abdul razak dawood tweeted that most of this growth had come from an increase of 7.8pc in the import of raw materials and intermediate goods (which is reflected by an increase in the manufacturing output in recent months) even though the imports of capital goods declined by 0.2pc. the imports of consumer goods also went down by 7.3pc.besides raw materials and intermediary goods imported by the industry, the increased purchases of food products especially wheat and sugar this year owing to domestic shortages also increased. the rising cotton imports on the back of the failure of the domestic crop at a time when the textile and clothing industry is operating at its full capacity to meet the export orders also forced the import bill to go up. T stands at $1.95bn in the july to february period. in addition to them, the spike in the energy prices oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) too played its part in raising the dollar value of the import bill and consequently the trade deficit.analysts agree that the trade deficit will likely remain wide in the remaining four months of the current fiscal year as imports will continue to post growth as the global economy reopens while the domestic demand for food products, cotton and industrial machinery is expected to stay high. driven by food imports and domestic economic activity, imports are projected by the central bank to surpass their annual target of $42.4bn. according to the state bank of pakistan governor reza baqir, the industry has already opened letters of credit worth $1bn for importing machinery for new projects or expansion and balancing, modernisation and replacement of the existing ones under the banks concessionat the trade gap will continue to expand. however, he recently told dawn that the increase in exports and remittances would offset the impact of the rising imports on the current account (for the time being at least). the banks have so far approved TERF loans of over rs 430bn or equal to 1pc of the GDP. the rising global oil prices and commodities like palm oil etc may further swell the import bill and, in turn, the trade gap.while imports are likely to rise, pakistans overseas shipments are anticipated to decline in the next four months as its regional competitors india and bangladesh reopen their economies and the textile and clothing importers from the US and europe return to their old suppliers. however, the textile industry, which comprises almost 60pc of the nations total export revenues, is confident of retaining a larger share of the new export orders despite reopening india and bangladesh. the trys external sector. although we have been managing the balance-of-payment situation with the help of unanticipated growth in workers remittances as well as foreign loans, this is not going to sustain for a very long time and we may face a new economic bust in next few years. the only sustainable way forward is to boost exports through expanding the product range, finding new markets, as well as attracting foreign direct investment in export industries by escalating work on the development of special economic zones with plug-and-play facilities.

Women and their lives of unrecognised toil,2021-03-08,Dawn,"Social biases, slow implementation of female-friendly legislation and a high cost of choosing to challenge the archaic power framework did not stop women of Pakistan from pursuing their passion and fending for families.Following the lead of resistance icons like Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, rape survivor Mukhtaran Mai and the brave human rights activist Asma Jahangir, they are marching on, beating odds, contributing to home-making and nation-building, striving for wage parity, exercising right to education, breaking glass ceilings and transforming society in the process.The compelling business case for a gender-focused approach to investment decisions in public and private sectors has nudged the government and companies to take interest in applying a gender lens. The slow progress towards gender parity, however, hammers into the need to do more.The female participation and visibility in the economic mainstream have persistently been increasing in Pakistan. Be it the factory floor, office, education, research, health, housekeeping, administration, entertainment, hospitality, banking, IT, marketing, media, grooming or politics, female presence is noticeable.

Promoting women-driven SMEs,2021-03-08,Tribune,"KARACHI:In August 2017, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) introduced a refinance and credit guarantee scheme for women entrepreneurs.The purpose was to enable women entrepreneurs to do more and do better in their respective fields of small business. The purpose also was to encourage more women to become entrepreneurs and initiate their own business.At that time, the SBP had fixed the refinance and credit guarantee limit at Rs1.5 million for each eligible woman entrepreneur. Three years later, in August 2020, the central bank raised the limit to Rs5 million.A refinance scheme works like this. The central bank encourages commercial banks to lend to a particular segment of borrowers at below-market interest rates because it believes lending to that sector is necessary for the benefit to the economy.In a credit guarantee scheme, commercial banks are reassured that their potential losses in extending loans to the targeted borrowers will be compensated to a large extent by the central bank. In case of the credit guarantee scheme for women entrepreneurs, the central bank provides 60% risk coverage to the banks that lend to them. This refinance and credit guarantee scheme has its own merits. But more needs to be done to promote the culture of entrepreneurship among women and promote women-driven small and medium enterprises (SMEs).While offering financial support to women entrepreneurs under the refinance and credit guarantee scheme, banks are currently focusing mostly on what is referred to as growth/ opportunity entrepreneurs.The World Bank defines this class of entrepreneurs as the ones who aspire to create a large, vibrant business that grows far beyond the scope of their subsistence needs and provides jobs for others. Examples of such women-driven enterprises include SMEs of branded clothing, shoes and self-care/ beauty products.Banks are also providing financial support to women-driven beauty parlours, clinics and medical centres, online food shops, etc ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ mostly in big cities like Karachi and Lahore.Subsistence entrepreneursBut there is another class of women entrepreneurs ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ much larger in size than the one mentioned above ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ that get very little attention of banks in urban areas. They fall in the category that the World Bank labels as necessity/ subsistence entrepreneurs.These entrepreneurs, as the name suggests, are the ones that engage in entrepreneurial activity to provide subsistence income to themselves and their close families. In Korangi, Keamari, North Karachi, New Karachi, Orangi and Surjani neighbourhoods of Karachi, thousands of women are running microenterprises to support just themselves and their families.They bake breads, prepare pickles and jams, sell cooked food, clean and cut fish, run tuition centres and mini-beauty parlours, sew clothes and even make shoes. Most banks never bother to reach out to them, assess their financial needs and offer them credit facility, either individually or through cluster formations. A few microfinance banks that claim they do it end up lending to growth/ opportunity women entrepreneurs.In rural areas of Pakistan, microfinance institutions (MFIs) have long been catering to both necessity/ subsistence and growth/ opportunity categories of women entrepreneurs. And, their lending has undoubtedly made a difference in the lives of rural womenfolk. But that said, the potential for such lending is being exploited a bit slowly. In August last year, the central bank asked all the banks participating in the refinance and credit guarantee scheme to ensure the processing of loan applications of women within 30 days, which is a laudable move. The central bank also instructed them to ensure that 20% of the total volume of earmarked funds under the refinance and credit guarantee scheme is lent to women in Balochistan. That also is a laudable move.But issuing instructions to banks is not enough. Ensuring compliance in true letter and spirit is everything.Financing trendAccording to the SBP, the stock of SME financing fell from Rs422 billion in September 2019 to Rs386 billion in September 2020. (This trend must have been reversed by now due to lending to SMEs from October 2020 onwards as part of concessionary financing under the Covid-related fiscal and monetary package).One hopes that while reporting data in future, the SBP would inform the nation how much money is lent to women-driven SMEs. It was being projected since 2015 that the number of women borrowers of all types, including those seeking enterprise loans from banks, would shoot up from 2 million in 2015 to 4.6 million in 2020. According to the Pakistan Microfinance Network (PMN), the number of active women borrowers from microfinance institutions gradually increased from 2 million in 2015 to 3.8 million in 2019.But given the sorry state of affairs of the entire SME sector, it is too much to expect that women-driven SMEs are being financed generously. Part of the problem lies on the demand side.Demand for official financing originating from women-driven SMEs cannot be expected to increase.

President Alvi said the country's laws reiterated the teachings of Islam that focused on ensuring rights of women in all spheres of life. He emphasized on economic empowerment of women to help them thrive in the society with dignity. Without financial independence, there was hardly an independence, he added.He said the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s laws ensured right of inheritance to women as taught by the religion, however, stressed the need for social reformation to promote the trend.Dr Alvi mentioned that under the socio-welfare Ehsaas programme, women were the direct beneficiaries of the government's stipend aimed at their uplifting. In terms of ensuring return of loans, he said, the women worldwide had been proved more responsible and reliable compared to the men.He said the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan had approved loan disbursement of Rs 5 million for women to launch their businesses and urged those intending for entrepreneurship to avail the facility. In the healthcare sector, the president emphasized on launch of Tele Health services for women to provide them prompt and free medical advice on telephone. He pointed out that frequent pregnancies resulted in malnutrition of women and newborns, and stressed that breastfeeding for continuous two years could ensure birth spacing.President Alvi said the Muslim traditions were enriched with examples of a balanced society and quoted historian Ibn-e-Khuldun's book 'Muqadimah' that mentioned the golden culture of equality of men and women. Similar traditions, he said, needed to be incorporated in the present day society by providing women an equitable platform to showcase their abilities and professionalism.The president acknowledged the services rendered by the country's women during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly doctors and paramedics. However, he expressed concern that a large number of professional women doctors left the profession after marriage compared with their 70 percent ratio of enrollment in medical colleges.He stressed the need for a change in the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s employment structure to accommodate the educated women and help them cope with the needs of both profession and family side by side.He also favoured the womenÃ¢Â€Â™s more effective electoral representation, decision-making opportunities and safer environment at workplaces sans harassment. Dr Alvi expressed concern over the retrogressive laws in the making in Europe in the wake of Islamophobia to target Muslims, including women. He said the media could play an important role in changing cultural scriptures about problems such as domestic violence by portraying it as an ill-practice. The president said the role of Ulema (religious figures) could prove effective in supporting healthcare issues, including breastfeeding and population control. Federal Minister for Human Rights Dr Shireen Mazari said the women had played a forefront role in the national development right from the creation of Pakistan by standing shoulder-to-shoulder with their male counterparts. She said whether it was struggle for family laws in the era of 60s or the present day 'Aurat March' and 'Haya March', women of the country always championed their rights with diversity in views or forms. She said the government's amendments in inheritance laws led to smooth dispensation of justice and mentioned that soon the bill on amendment in Protection of Women Against Harassment at Workplace Act would be tabled in National Assembly. She urged upon the international community to take serious note of the rape incidents of Kashmiri women and the detention of women political leaders in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, besides the persistent violation of Geneva Convention. Minister for Defence Production Zubaida Jalal said education and financial security was the basis of women empowerment that gave strength to girls and women to make their mark in all fields of life. She mentioned that the school, she had founded 38 years ago in Balochistan's Mand village, paved way for local girls to excel as a pilot, bankers and paramedics. During the COVID-19, she said, as an educationist, she started first 'camel library' in different areas of Balochistan to help children continue their studies during lockdown. She mentioned that 200 women had recently joined Frontier Corps in Balochistan in the fight against terrorism. Dr Fehmida Mirza, Member of National Assembly and former NA speaker, said the women could harness their potential and achieve tremendously if provided a level-playing field instead of the treatment of gender bias. She proposed a gender-specific national budgeting, a 10 percent quota in party tickets in general elections and an intensive post-legislative scrutiny of Harassment at Workplace Act to make it more inclusive. EU Ambassador to Pakistan Androulla Kaminara said a conducive legal environment and a gender sensitive approach was need of the hour. She termed the government's Ehsaas programme 'transformative' in financially empowering the underprivileged women during pandemic. She said the European Union's partnership with Pakistan supported equal representation of women in all fields of life for the country's brighter future. Sharmeela Rasool, United Nations Women Country Head, said women's equal participation was vital for Pakistan's development and for achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. She lauded several pro-women laws as part of the Government of Pakistan's Vision 2025. Given the male-dominated environment, she said, the UN Women emphasized on ensuring power of political decision-making for Pakistani women, which could lead to their greater social protection. Secretary Human Rights Inamullah Khan said the Human Rights Ministry took stringent steps regarding policy-making, monitoring mechanism and institutional reforms, particularly protection of property rights and the Zainab Alert Bill against child abuse. He paid tribute to the women, who had challenged stereotypes of gender discrimination and worked diligently as healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rakhshanda Naz, Khyber Pukhtunkhwa's Ombudsperson against Harassment said the Domestic Violence Act 2021 and Property Rights Act were significant steps of the government in ensuring rights of the women. She stressed the provincial legislation for gender audit of each state institution, provision of equal resources and opportunities to women and enactment of laws against child marriage and domestic labour. Zara Naeem, who scored the highest marks in ACCA worldwide, termed Mohtarma Fatima Jinnah as the ideal for the country's women in view of her leadership, vision and steadfastness. Positive approach, focus and faith in Almighty Allah leads to success, she added. Erum Baloch, the country's youngest hockey player from Sindh's Jacobbadad town termed the occasion momentous for acknowledging the contribution of sportswomen in surpassing challenges.  Reem Sharif, the first transgender officer of Punjab Police, mentioned that the government's support through Transgender Persons Act 2018, Sehat Insaf Card and employment in public institutions were important steps in ensuring life as a respectful citizen. An inspirational song 'Sar Buland' penned by activist Samar Minallah was played on the occasion highlighting women as a source of strength and resilience. A video presentation showed the government's Helpline 1099 as the Ã¢Â€Â˜24/7 saviour for the victims of domestic violenceÃ¢Â€Â™. A live musical performance by young artistes Shamu Bai and Vishnu belonging to the rural Sindh enthralled the audience with their ode 'Faqira'. A short drama documentary 'Tum Mazboot Ho' (You are strong) was screened to show a girl's dream to be powerful enough to save her mother from domestic violence and an awareness story on the laws protecting women's share in inheritance.

"DPO Sonia Shamroz is lowering the suicide rate in Chitral, one conversation at a time",2021-03-08,Dawn,"This Women's Day we're honouring the strong women who are making our communities safer for everyone, especially women, to live and thrive in. One such icon is Khyber PakhtunkhwaÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s first woman District Police Officer (DPO), Sonia Shamroz, who recently joined the Chitral police. Growing up, her family made sure nothing was unachievable for Shamroz and her four sisters. Years later, that encouragement propelled Shamroz on her path to become the first woman DPO in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Women make up less than two percent of the overall police force in Pakistan with the percentage even lower in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. While this speaks volumes about Shamroz's determination, it also gives us an idea of the challenges she must have faced on her journey to the top. Always fond of pursuing the road less travelled, Shamroz grew up in a family that had no members working for the government. Early on, she had the opportunity to study at Army Burn Hall College. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½The discipline of the reasons I appeared for the CSS exam,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ she told Images.Appearing for the exam and acing it was the easy part; it was the journey that came afterwards that was challenging. Shamroz was the first woman with a child and train to be a police officer but thanks to a supportive husband and in-laws, who took care of her daughter during her training, she was able to complete her training. Her first assignment was as an assistant superintendent of police in Mansehra, which was a huge learning opportunity for her. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Initially people would be confused and sceptical to see a woman in the police but my efforts and work gave them confidence in me. In Mansehra, I visited crime scenes and we caught criminals, which really changed the way the public perceived women police officials.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Shamroz has also served in Oghi and Abbottabad as well as being the principal of the Police Training School in Mansehra. She was then chosen as a Chevening Scholar nited Kingdom. She is one of several women police officers to take part in a training session on disaster response arranged by the United Nations Development Programme Pakistan Amn-o-Insaf Programme, which is actively working to increase womenÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s representation in law enforcement through advocacy, training and creating conducive and enabling environments for women officers to thrive.Without her familyÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s support and these value adding experiences and training, Shamroz would not have come this far. She recently joined the Chitral Police as a DPO but whatÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s more remarkable is what she has been accomplishing ever since she took office.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½According to her, Chitral has two major issues: the first is a high suicide rate with a majority of the victims being women. She feels that the women there feel suppressed, lack opportunities and have no one to complain to. A lot of young girls commit suicide especially when they king a solution, they end their lives. The second issue is the prevalence of Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½down district marriagesÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½, in which men from lower districts and other provinces come to North Chitral and marry younger girls, often by paying off their parents.  To overcome these problems, Shamroz has operationalised three gender responsive desks (GRDs) at model police stations established by the UNDPÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s Amn-o-Insaf Programme with support from European Union in Lower Chitral. She appointed women officials at these desks to encourage women to come and discuss their problems instead of committing suicide. Shamroz also trained her staff on gender responsive policing to change the environment of police stations and encourage women to freely visit to report violations. Since operationalising these desks in January, over 100 cases have been successfully solved. A social worker working in Lower Chitral, who chooses to remain anonymous, told Images that she was gigure out what to do. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Finally I decided to get in touch with the newly set up women desk at the Chitral Police Station and DPO Sonia and officer Dilshad Pari investigated the matter. In a short time, they found the culprit and punished him.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½This is one of the many cases that have been solved at the Gender Responsive Desks in Lower Chitral but more importantly, these cases are strengthening womenÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s belief that they will get justice if they speak up. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½It has only been two months of making these efforts and there has only been one case of suicide. My team has successfully saved a few cases from the site when some women were trying to jump in the river, counselled them and resolved the issue,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ Shamroz told Images. She believes that increasing womenÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s representation in law enforcement is crucial. Women make up almost half of Pakistan's population and in order ater to women complainants and hear them out, let alone work towards solving their cases and challenges,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ explained Shamroz.She added that one of the most effective ways to increase women representation in law enforcement is to give them senior leadership roles, so young girls can look up to them, be inspired and follow the same route. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½When I joined the force, I didnÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t have many examples to look up to, but I hope the few of u","DPO sonia shamroz is lowering the suicide rate in chitral, one conversation at a time this women day we are honouring the strong women who are making our communities safer for everyone, especially women, to live and thrive in. one such icon is khyber pakhtunkhwas first woman district police officer (DPO), sonia shamroz, who recently joined the chitral police. growing up, her family made sure nothing was unachievable for shamroz and her four sisters. years later, that encouragement propelled shamroz on her path to become the first woman DPO in khyber Pakhtunkhwa.Women make up less than two percent of the overall police force in pakistan with the percentage even lower in khyber pakhtunkhwa. while this speaks volumes about shamroz determination, it also gives us an idea of the challenges she must have faced on her journey to the top. always fond of pursuing the road less travelled, shamroz grew up in a family that had no members working for the government. early on, she had the opportunity to study at army burn hall college. the discipline of the reasons I appeared for the CSS exam, she told Images.Appearing for the exam and acing it was the easy part it was the journey that came afterwards that was challenging. shamroz was the first woman with a child and train to be a police officer but thanks to a supportive husband and in-laws, who took care of her daughter during her training, she was able to complete her training. her first assignment was as an assistant superintendent of police in mansehra, which was a huge learning opportunity for her. initially people would be confused and sceptical to see a woman in the police but my efforts and work gave them confidence in me. in mansehra, I visited crime scenes and we caught criminals, which really changed the way the public perceived women police officials.shamroz has also served in oghi and abbottabad as well as being the principal of the police training school in mansehra. she was then chosen as a chevening scholar nited kingdom. she is one of several women police officers to take part in a training session on disaster response arranged by the united nations development programme pakistan Amn-o-Insaf programme, which is actively working to increase womens representation in law enforcement through advocacy, training and creating conducive and enabling environments for women officers to thrive.without her familys support and these value adding experiences and training, shamroz would not have come this far. she recently joined the chitral police as a DPO but whats more remarkable is what she has been accomplishing ever since she took office.according to her, chitral has two major issues the first is a high suicide rate with a majority of the victims being women. she feels that the women there feel suppressed, lack opportunities and have no one to complain to.

SBP bill causes major controversy,2021-03-27,Business Recorder,"The federal cabinet early this week approved the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)  Ã¢Â€Â˜Amendment Bill 2021Ã¢Â€Â™. Reportedly, the bill advocates fundamental changes in the SBP founding laws of 1956. According to finance minister Dr Hafeez Sheikh, the SBPÃ¢Â€Â™s sole mandate would be Ã¢Â€Âœprice control and to independently set monetary policy and exchange rate policy.Ã¢Â€ÂThe amendments include administrative changes such as the term of office of the SBP governor shall be five years, the government shall not borrow or seek guarantees from the SBP for its operations, and the remuneration, terms and conditions of the service of the governor and deputy governors will be determined by the SBP board. The governor shall submit bankÃ¢Â€Â™s annual report before the parliament regarding the achievement of its objectives, conduct of monetary policy, state of the economy and overall functioning of financial system. The parliament may require any senior official to attend at such additional times as may be required.Ã¢Â€Â The proposed amendments seek protection to actions taken in good faith by providing indemnity, Ã¢Â€ÂœNo suit, prosecution or any other legal proceedings including for damages shall lie against the bank, its board of directors or members, governor, deputy governors and support for economic policies of the government has been declared as the Ã¢Â€Âœtertiary objectiveÃ¢Â€Â of the SBP. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cannot investigate the SBP governor, deputy governors, its executives and board and committee members including its former officials without permission of its board of directors. Whereas, on the legislation side, the federal government cannot make legislation without consulting the SBP. Ã¢Â€ÂœThe bank shall be consulted ex ante on any proposed legislative act related to the Bank,Ã¢Â€Â states Section 46B sub-section 8 of the ordinance. The definition of Ã¢Â€Âœmonetary liabilitiesÃ¢Â€Â has been introduced, which means total liabilities of the bank as reduced by the sum of Ã¢Â€Âœdeposits of the government, amounts owing to the IMF, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) or other such instruments, deposits of foreign central banks or sovereign wealth funds, utilised swap lines of foreign central banks and balance of participant central banks under any clearing unionÃ¢Â€Â.The proposed amendment bill has invited an outcry from the leading economists and analysts of the country - with wide coverage in the print, social and electronic media of the country. In the event of passage of this bill as is, the SBP governor perceived by some as an IMF insider, is being portrayed as an Ã¢Â€Â˜Economic ViceroyÃ¢Â€Â™ and the IMF as the East India Company out to usurp the sovereignty of the nation.Dramatic reforms in a country are difficult to be absorbed. Some oppose them out of vested interests and some out of emotions and lack of any rational approach, with some on merit. Setting aside for a while the apprehensions and opinions of the economists of the country, one is tempted to ponder on some basic and undeniable facts to draw out a logical conclusion based on some analytical and rational understanding.The IMF is a lending bank and like all lenders it lends money and ensures that the borrower has sufficient means and fiscal discipline to repay it. To ensure that, it would go to any lengths. In the 1990s, in the face of a severe economic crisis, India approached the IMF for a bailout. IndiaÃ¢Â€Â™s fiscal situation was so bad that the IMF refused to accept IndiaÃ¢Â€Â™s sovereign guarantees and instead demanded India deposited its bullion reserves as hard collateral. The then finance minister of India, Yashwant Sinha, ensured that tons of bullion was flown out from the vaults of Delhi treasury to the IMF vaults in London. Such is the extent to which IMF can go with its member clients. It is also a fact that sectoral regulators in Pakistan, by design, have been rendered ineffective and compromised. So much so that the former government stripped regulators Nepra and Ogra of their independent status and placed them under the line Ministry of Power and Oil & Gas, respectively. Whereas, countryÃ¢Â€Â™s prime regulatory bodies, including SBPÃ¢Â€Â™s, have largely been headed by the hand-picked political appointees.The clause to insulate SBP Governor, its principal officers and the board members from intervention of NAB and FIA is understandable. This Ã¢Â€Â˜precautionÃ¢Â€Â™ stems from an ongoing NAB investigation against SBP officers in the alleged non-transparent merger of the KASB and BankIslami. SBP executives fear that more of their actions would be challenged by NAB and FIA. But, similar has also been the demand of the bureaucracy and elite businessmen of the country as they want to conduct their responsibilities free from fear and perceived or real harassment by NAB. In case of SBP this condition may sail through under the guise of IMF flag, although it is unlikely that the Fund would put up this condition and meddle in the criminal law of the land. Their concern is limited to the independence of SBP and other regulatory entities of Pakistan. The clause pertaining to absolute autonomy to the board of SBP to conduct its business is similar to the recently rolled out reforms for the management of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) where the entity boards have been delegated the principal responsibility to its business free from political and bureaucratic interventions. Be that as it may, the country has to just settle the IMF loan and walk out to freedom. Unless we do that, the IMF and its dictates are here to stay.

Film industry: a soft determinant of economic growth,2021-03-27,Tribune,"The 15th death anniversary of the legendary filmstar Muhammad Ali was observed on March 19. He acted in over 250 movies and was one of AsiaÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s 25 greatest actors. How could the accolades of a filmstar or industry be related with economic growth, is a rudimentary question underpinning the revival of Pakistan film industry. Its answer can be found by analysing the film industry as an economic institution.Economic growth is a context-dependent phenomenon. Prof JuÃƒÂŒÃ‚Âˆri Sepp, in his paper, ""Soft Factors of Economic Development: Human Capital and Institutions"", notes that economic theory has always been struggling to answer what determines a country's economic growth. It is because most countries underestimate the challenges between ambition and reality enshrined in their policy visions. The same is the case with Pakistan. The downfall of PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s film industry is a result of ill-conceived dubious national visions. In recent past, the country produced didactic documents on long-term vision to galvanise economic growth including Vision 2025, Vision 2030, and the Framework for Economic Growth (FEG).Similar to JuÃƒÂŒÃ‚Âˆri's arguments, the FEG came up with two categories of growth parameters. One is termed as 'software' such as management and productivity while the other is 'hardware' like physical infrastructure. Film industry is primarily a part of the software category. Historically, Pakistan's primary focus has been on the hardware, such as roads and infrastructure, and not software such as culture, art, people and values. Denigrating collision between the culture and religion has also created several impediments in making quality films. As a result, the film industry was not recognised as a vibrant determinant of economic growth. The same approach prevailed globally till 1978 when Thomus Guback wrote ""Are We Looking at the Right Things in Film?"" He noted that film studies neglected rational analysis of cinema as an economic institution.Pakistan needs to rely more on soft factors of economic growth, like the United States. Hollywood is an example of how a film industry can act as an economic institution. Most American movies dominate international film markets. A political economist of media, Prof Janet Wasko, emphasises that a film needs to be placed within an entire economic, social and political context for maintaining and reproducing structures of power. Many movies, such as True Lies, were meant at achieving geopolitical objectives by justifying American military operations worldwide. Following Janet's argument, the topics of PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s film industry must have economic, social and political context. Choorian is a good example of the social context in which a love story and village culture were highlighted. In terms of economics, the director, Syed Noor, and actors such as Saima, Moammar and Nargis, are rich human capital for the industry. Their experience needs to be utilised for similar movies.On the politico-economic front, the emergence of China as an economic giant has changed power structures globally. Pakistan's close alignment with China and CPEC has created new power structures in South Asia. PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s film industry, as an economic institution, can play a pivotal role in bolstering economic growth and strengthening new geostrategic power relations. Many intelligence operations, in the country's defense, can be performed through quality films. The documents relating to Pakistan's policy vision must, therefore, define the micro-level processes which, among other factors, need to treat the film industry as a determinant of economic growth. Accordingly, the awards won by actors and films are a commodity and need to be seen as a tangible product and intangible service. This could be a great objective to be achieved on the 15th death anniversary of actor Muhammad Ali.","film industry a soft determinant of economic growth the 15th death anniversary of the legendary filmstar muhammad ali was observed on march 19. he acted in over 250 movies and was one of asias 25 greatest actors. how could the accolades of a filmstar or industry be related with economic growth, is a rudimentary question underpinning the revival of pakistan film industry. its answer can be found by analysing the film industry as an economic institution.economic growth is a context-dependent phenomenon. prof juri sepp, in his paper, ""soft factors of economic development human capital and institutions"", notes that economic theory has always been struggling to answer what determines a country economic growth. it is because most countries underestimate the challenges between ambition and reality enshrined in their policy visions. the same is the case with pakistan. the downfall of pakistans film industry is a result of ill-conceived dubious national visions. in recent past, the country produced didactic documents on long-term vision to galvanise economic growth including vision 2025, vision 2030, and the framework for economic growth (FEG).Similar to juri arguments, the FEG came up with two categories of growth parameters. one is termed as oftware' such as management and productivity while the other is 'hardware' like physical infrastructure. film industry is primarily a part of the software category. historically, pakistan primary focus has been on the hardware, such as roads and infrastructure, and not software such as culture, art, people and values. denigrating collision between the culture and religion has also created several impediments in making quality films. as a result, the film industry was not recognised as a vibrant determinant of economic growth. the same approach prevailed globally till 1978 when thomus guback wrote ""are we looking at the right things in film?"" he noted that film studies neglected rational analysis of cinema as an economic institution.pakistan needs to rely more on soft factors of economic growth, like the united states. hollywood is an example of how a film industry can act as an economic institution. most american movies dominate international film markets.

Congratulations to both on their new journey.Ã¢Â€ÂIn another tweet, he claimed that new alignment is being made to confront the PML-N in the next general elections.

Pakistan working to cut port charges,2021-03-27,Tribune,"KARACHI:Pakistan has kick-started the process of cutting port charges to bring down the cost of imports and exports and to increase its footprints in facilitating regional and international trade transportation through sea.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe port charges come somewhere between $50,000 to $100,000 per ship depending upon the size of the ship and the number of days it spends to download or upload cargo at a port in the country,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â said Pakistan ShipÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Agents Association (PSAA) Chairman Mohammed Rajpar while talking to The Express Tribune.He spoke after attending the very first meeting of the committee formed by the cabinet to rationalise port charges.The committee has been tasked to reduce the cost of doing business and increase the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s competitiveness in facilitating regional and international trade transportation through offering better price and quality services.The major port charges include port dues, pilotage in, pilotage out, pilotage charges, ship berthing and storage, it was learnt.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœOur competition (in the region) is with ports of Colombo in Sri Lanka, Salalah in Oman and Jebel Ali in Dubai in transshipment,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â said Rapar, who is also a member of the committee.Local traders alone pay an estimated $5-6 billion in freight charges, including port charges, for import and export in a year, it was learnt.The port charges are targeted to be rationalised to create ease of doing business like the incumbent government has been doing in all sectors to reduce the cost of doing business in Pakistan, he said.To recall, the cost of doing business has gone up in the country following increase in power tariff, passing on the increase in international oil prices to local consumers. Besides, the gas utility firms have once again requested the government to increase gas price as well.The government is bound to increase prices under stringent conditions of the International Monetary FundÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s (IMF) loan programme worth $6 billion.Accordingly, the average inflation reading has remained high at over 8% on an average in the first eight months (Jul-Feb) of current fiscal year against the government target of 6.1% for the year.The average reading may end up somewhere 9% for the full year.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœDuring the meeting, avenues were explored for rationalising port charges in comparison to regional ports.

Official spot rate down Rs300 amid slow activity,2021-03-27,Business Recorder,"KARACHI: The Spot Rate Committee of the Karachi Association on Friday has decreased the spot rate by Rs 300 per maund and closed it at Rs 11,900 per maund. Market sources told that under the influence of international market local market remained bearish on Thursday. Market sources told that trading volume remained low because of fluctuation in the price of dollar as compared to international market where dollar is strengthening. Sources told that reason behind bearish trend worldwide is increasing tension between China and America on economic front. ICE cotton futures tumbled over 4.5% to trade limit down on Thursday, pressured by a weak export sales data and a stronger dollar. The most active cotton contract on ICE Futures US, the front-month May contract fell 4.00 cents, or 4.9%, to 78.44 cents per lb at 12:23 p.m. EDT (1623 GMT), its lowest since Jan. 4.

New sales were definitely a bit lower and we saw cancellations from China,Ã¢Â€Â said Bailey Thomen, cotton risk management associate with StoneX Group.The US Department of AgricultureÃ¢Â€Â™s weekly export sales report showed that net sales of 271,200 running bales (RB) for 2020/2021 were down 38% from the previous week, with a 1,800-RB reduction from China.The report also showed that exports of 313,500 RB were down 11%. Ã¢Â€ÂœSo, it is a combination of a pullback in demand and also these broader economic and political factors as well,Ã¢Â€Â Thomen said, pointing to concerns regarding US-China relations. The United States is the biggest exporter of cotton, while China is the largest consumer. The dollar index rose to a more than four-month high against key rivals, making cotton costlier for investors holding other currencies. Total futures market volume rose by 30,895 to 61,439 lots. Data showed total open interest gained 2,428 to 232,040 contracts in the previous session.Cotton Analyst Naseem Usman told that exporters have halted yarn sales as the depreciating dollar slashed their profit margins, resulting in higher availability of the raw material at cheaper rates in the domestic market, sources from the value-added textile sector said on Tuesday.Meanwhile, industry sources were also hopeful that the recent initiative by Pakistan for normalisation of relations with India could pave the way for cheaper cotton yarn imports from across the border.The value-added textile sector has been demanding the government to allow import of yarn from India since prices are cheaper while the locally produced yarn is costlier. Spinners who produce yarn were of the view that the raw material was costlier due to costly cotton imports.With the falling greenback rates, imported cotton would also be much cheaper for the industry in Pakistan. Pakistan is importing cotton from many countries including the United States which increased the cost of production. Cotton production in the country fell by 34.4 per cent against the target while consumption continues to increase.Ã¢Â€ÂœThe recent decline in yarn prices is neither significant nor there is any surety that prices would remain stable as it is mainly because of a sudden drop in US dollar prices,Ã¢Â€Â said Aamir Aziz, an exporter of finished textile products.Naseem told that 400 bales of Dherki were sold at Rs 11800 per maund, 1600 bales of Khan Pur were sold at Rs 11950 to Rs 12000 per maund and 400 bales of Rahim Yar Khan were sold at Rs 11600 per maund.Naseem also told that rate of cotton in Sindh was in between Rs 10,300 to Rs 11500 per maund.

Non-alignment is a worn-out misnomer. indias non-alignment did not prevent jawaharlal nehru from seeking covertly behind the back of indias ambassador asaf ali a written alliance with the US in 1948. note that the nato partnership is shorn of guarantee of help in article 5 of the NATO treaty of 1949, which reads the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in europe or north america shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently, they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by article 51 of the charter of the united nations, will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the useforeign relations committee this naturally does not mean that the united states would automatically be at war if one of the other signatory nations were the victim of an armed attack. under the treaty we would be bound to make an honest judgement as to what action was necessary to attain that end and consequently to take such action. that action might or might not include the use of armed force.as de gaulle remarked, treaties, like roses and pretty girls, last only as long as they last. how did pakistans pacts with the US help, in its moments of crisis in the 1965 and 1971 wars? treaties are concluded in the national interest purely. help is extended in the same spirit. in 1962, it took the US long to support indias case on the border and even that was confined to the McMahon line not the aksai chin in ladakh. india has unwisely let skirmishes on an undefined border ratchet its"
Schrodinger's dove,2021-03-27,Tribune,"A piece on international relations ought not to start with an illustration from quantum mechanics. But it will become abundantly clear to the reader in the ensuing paras that there is no other way. Most of you must be aware of the theoretical experiment called Schrodinger's cat. For those who do not, I seek your indulgence.In 1935, physicist Erwin Schrodinger used the case of a hypothetical cat to explain his thoughts on quantum superposition to Einstein. A cat and a vial of poison gas protected from the cat's reach are locked in a steel box, with an automatic trigger mechanism which may or may not release the gas. Until the box is opened and the result is found, to the experimenter the cat is both dead and alive. Hence the quantum superposition.Now, in this thought experiment replace the hypothetical cat with the universal symbol of peace ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â” a metaphoric dove. The thought of this was triggered by the debate surrounding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent letter to Prime Minister Imran Khan congratulating the people of Pakistan on its national day. This letter did not materialise out of a vacuum. Only a few days ago Modi had wished the Pakistani Premier a swift recovery from the Covid infection in a tweet. After a two-year hiatus, the Pakistani team was already in India to talk about the Indus Water Treaty dispute resolution. And in February, the Director Generals of Military Operations (DGMO) of both sides got in touch and put out a statement vowing to strictly observe all agreements and ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC). In the intervening period we heard the PM and the Army Chief's speeches at the Islamabad Security Dialogue (ISD).The last bit is a constant. Pakistani leaders have indefatigably extended the hand of friendship to India. From the Indian side however, the response has been incredibly temperamental ever since India decided to cut off its democratic nose to spite the Pakistani face and elected Modi. Since then the dove of peace is caged in the steel box with a vial of poison gas and an automatic trigger mechanism, both dead and alive simultaneously.The commentary on the recent developments has been quite remarkable to say the least. Immediately after the DGMO talk, as I pointed out back then, the Indian media went berserk. More than usual. India's Ajit Doval, it claimed, in an unmatched display of statecraft had pulled off this diplomatic coup of sorts through an ongoing back channel engagement. Perhaps he came here looking for the downed F-16 and met his counterpart. When democracy is dying, all you are left with is the glorification of ordinary mortals in power.Then came the Bloomberg story about a UAE-led diplomatic push. And recently another about a UK-sponsored back channel between the two countries. The reports are all over the place. I am sure every country that has the remotest interest in the matter would badly want the two to make peace. Actually, I know for a fact that the United States, China, Russia, the UK, Turkey, the Arab world, Europe, the SAARC countries especially Afghanistan and even the one that shall stay unnamed, all want this. But what do these two want?This, of course, is not our first rodeo. Throughout my life I have heard the ""good news"" of the two countries working on peace building. It invariably starts with a few confidence building measures (CBMs). Then some sports diplomacy in which the expectation is for Pakistan to throw the game. Then the media builds the hype. Leaders of the two sides meet. Then their teams start a structured dialogue. Then a press conference with a leading question or two from Muhammad Saleh Zaafir or Muhammad Hanif Khalid. After agreeing on almost everything else, when it comes to Kashmir and recently Siachen, the talks fall apart. When India doesn't want to talk, a terror attack somehow conveniently appears and the talks go out of the window. I am not claiming that every attack that takes place is a false-flag operation. I do not have all the facts to do that. All I do is study the context, the immediate background, the atmospherics, who wants what and who gains what in the end deeply. To you some of this may sound like conspiracy fiction. To me it is a lived reality.But what has changed this time? The nature and the quality of the CBMs. In the past it involved creating a genuine climate of cordiality. Cultural exchanges, improvement in visa policies, freeing of caged fishermen and gradual easing of tensions through the visits of business, media and religious delegations. The Indus water talks and the DGMO hotline were constant parts of the bilateral architecture independent of both the CBMs and the structured dialogue. Now they are not. Modi himself doesn't understand the slow but steady dance of peace. At times his government embroils itself in newly and unnecessarily added caveats and red lines compromising all diplomatic wiggle room, at others he does stuff like reaching Lahore unannounced to attend the wedding ceremony of the former PM's granddaughter. How is this diplomacy? In fact, matters of diplomatic niceties like wishing an under-the-weather colleague or congratulating a country on its national day now amount to confidence building. Mind you, if Modi, with all his learning disabilities, himself wrote that tweet and the letter, he has my sympathies for the hard labour that must have gone into it. I can see him with a pen and a paper agonising for hours to find the right words, poring over dictionaries, writing and deleting the unneeded lines. But something tells me, he did not. And from our side the CBMs involve all leaders constantly signalling the desire for peace atop their voices.Don't get me wrong. I am a peacenik. The said dove. But this is too little to go on. The onset of talks about the talks which may or may not lead to another round of talks which may or may not seriously address any of the real issues does not inspire confidence. The Modi government due to its mastery of all modes of social control can resurrect the hitherto defunct constituency of peace in India in a heartbeat. But on the day when these commentaries were dominating media discourse here and abroad, a viral video on social media was showing a BJP-allied RSS goon beating a poor Muslim man to the pulp in New Delhi asking him to say ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœPakistan murdabad (death to Pakistan)ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â. I think the message was loud and clear.I promise I will break my Sunday best out and dance the conga, if you insist, when the moment of peace comes. Until then, may I humbly suggest that you stop declaring victory without opening the steel box in which sit the peace constituencies of India and Pakistan, in a quantum superposition, both dead and alive at the same time.

"Pakistan's lawyers turn fashion police, tell waiters to stop wearing their 'uniform'",2021-03-27,Dawn,"Pakistan's lawyers have a lot to deal with Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ human rights violations, honour killings, property disputes, defamation and, most importantly, fashion faux pax. Three bar councils in Pakistan have issued statements condemn""their uniforms"".Our esteemed lawyers are trying to be the fashion police. They say that other than them, no one should be allowed to wear their uniform. But the uniform in question is a black suit with a white shirt and black tie. Here are a list of places that you can wear this outfit: To work as a bodyguardTo work as a waiterTo your own weddingTo a black-tie dinnerTo work (not at a law firm)To school (if you want to be fancy)To the gym (sweatpants are overrated)To Empress Market to buy vegetablesAnd the list goes on and on. But if you were to ask a lawyer in Punjab, Islamabad or Balochistan, they would say they are the only ones allowed to wear black suits.Bar councils are representative bodies of lawyers. The Punjab Bar Council has written a letter to the chief secretary, the Islamabad Bar Council to the chief commissioner of Islamabad and the Balochistan Bar Council has issued a statement. The gist of all three statements is the same.""It came to our knowledge, many of the Hotels & Marriage Hall Staff is wearing the uniform of Lawyers. Through this letter I am clearing this, A Law Graduate cannot wear the proper uniform of lawyer unless until he passed the entry test and complete his six month training period [sic],"" reads the Punjab Bar Council letter.  ""Nobody is allowed to wear the Uniform of Lawyers except the lawyers. If any body will found in the uniform of lawyers at any place, marriage hall, hotels, event hall, I have clear directions to proceed under the relevant provision of Law [sic]."" This isn't a new issue. Lawyers have been wanting complete dominion over black suits for a while. Their fashion claim suffered a blow in 2015, when the Lahore High Court dismissed an appeal asking the court to stop waiters from wearing black suits. Justice Ayesha A Malik had dismissed the petition, saying the court could not issue directions on what citizens could or could not wear. Since a court has already turned down the lawyers' demand for fashion supremacy, it's unclear what legal action they will be proceeding with. It is also unclear what the issue is with someone else wearing their uniform. Do they consider waiters or wedding hall staff beneath them and therefore unworthy of wearing this rather mundane set of clothes? Or do they believe that despite their degrees and experience, someone in a courtroom is likely to ask them to bring over a plate of biryani with raita and a cold bottle of 7 Up?On Twitter, people were as amused as we are with this development.       Others raised good points.   In fact, many of the people making fun of this news were lawyers themselves.

Dangerous addiction of non-stop borrowing,2021-03-28,Business Recorder,"EDITORIAL: It's no surprise really that Pakistan's habit of borrowing to survive has got so out of hand that even respected international financial institutions have started sounding the alarm. According to a report titled 'Developing Infrastructure in Central Asia, impacts and financing mechanisms' by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ABDI), Pakistan's external debt has now reached a level where any further borrowing seriously risks destabilising the whole economy. That, of course, is because requirements of debt servicing and interest payments prevent the country from using its resources for development of its infrastructure. And that brings us to the main problem about the debt that is clearly no longer sustainable. For we haven't just borrowed, and must now pay back, well above a hundred billion dollars just from external sources, but it's not very easy to see where all that money has gone.Surely none, or not very much, of it has gone into building any sort of infrastructure at all. With an energy crisis, a water crisis, and an economy in free-fall, Pakistan has the lowest development ranking in the region and stands at 110 out of 137 countries in terms of infrastructure. Over the years, this has led to declining business competitiveness, lower GDP growth and reduced tax revenue. The problem is now made much worse because debt repayment, along with things like defence spending and general administration, take up a lion's share of the budget and whatever money is urgently needed elsewhere is routinely cut from development spending. To make up for all this the government is forced to increase taxes on business and the general public, because there are always just too many feudal lords and industrial barons in parliament to allow any taxes to rise on the rich; and so we go round in circles.A depreciated rupee, whose fall was so widely celebrated as liberation of sorts from Ishaq Dar's tight control at about a hundred to the dollar, has also inflated interest payment in real terms. This is the kind of cocktail that spurs investors, both foreign and domestic one. They, therefore, do not hesitate to make a beeline for the exit lounge, delivering the economy a likely kiss of death because with the government's spending ability severely compromised, private money is very desperately needed to snap out of this vicious circle that has the country seeking fresh loans not just to stay above water and avoiding default on servicing and repayment of old loans all the time.This is indeed a very difficult situation to handle because it's not just a fiscal nightmare but also a national embarrassment that even the prime minister's kitchen runs on borrowed money, and therefore borrowed time. That brings us back to the question of just what these billions upon billions of dollars have been used for. Sadly, everybody knows that while the country was left locked in a cycle of borrow-to-survive and borrow-to-repay, a lot of people that signed on the dotted line also grew very rich in the years that the debt balloon was inflated. So, to cut a very long and unfortunate story short, the debt piled on, the country grew poorer, a few political families became very rich, and the rest of the people must now pay for it, figuratively as well as literally, for a number of generations. Sooner or later, the government will be forced to give infrastructure the kind of fiscal attention that it needs even after all the blessings that have come with the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). But, again, before that it would have to find ways to create some additional fiscal space. Yet there's no easy way to expand its list of available options. And just when the good news about the G20 debt moratorium came after the bad news of the pandemic and the lockdowns, some disturbing news also came about some of the world's top ratings agencies downgrading the sovereign ratings of some of the countries that availed the facility. That is very bad news for Pakistan, of course, since we are also in line for it. No doubt the government understands very well that the only thing standing between long-term survival and possible sovereign default somewhere down the road is precisely the ability to build enough infrastructure to fuel growth and improve revenue in time. Such things take much time, though, so the sooner the official machinery springs into action the better.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021","dangerous addiction of non-stop borrowing EDITORIAL it no surprise really that pakistan habit of borrowing to survive has got so out of hand that even respected international financial institutions have started sounding the alarm. according to a report titled 'developing infrastructure in central asia, impacts and financing mechanisms' by the asian development bank institute (ABDI), pakistan external debt has now reached a level where any further borrowing seriously risks destabilising the whole economy. that, of course, is because requirements of debt servicing and interest payments prevent the country from using its resources for development of its infrastructure. and that brings us to the main problem about the debt that is clearly no longer sustainable. for we haven't just borrowed, and must now pay back, well above a hundred billion dollars just from external sources, but it not very easy to see where all that money has gone.surely none, or not very much, of it has gone into building any sort of infrastructure at all. with an energy crisis, a water crisis, and an economy in free-fall, pakistan has the lowest development ranking in the region and stands at 110 out of 137 countries in terms of infrastructure. over the years, this has led to declining business competitiveness, lower GDP growth and reduced tax revenue. the problem is now made much worse because debt repayment, along with things like defence spending and general administration, take up a lion share of the budget and whatever money is urgently needed elsewhere is routinely cut from development spending. to make up for all this the government is forced to increase taxes on business and the general public, because there are always just too many feudal lords and industrial barons in parliament to allow any taxes to rise on the rich and so we go round in circles.a depreciated rupee, whose fall was so widely celebrated as liberation of sorts from ishaq dar tight control at about a hundred to the dollar, has also inflated interest payment in real terms. this is the kind of cocktail that spurs investors, both foreign and domestic one. they, therefore, do not hesitate to make a beeline for the exit lounge, delivering the economy a likely kiss of death because with the government spending ability severely compromised, private money is very desperately needed to snap out of this vicious circle that has the country seeking fresh loans not just to stay above water and avoiding default on servicing and repayment of old loans all the time.this is indeed a very difficult situation to handle because it not just a fiscal nightmare but also a national embarrassment that even the prime minister kitchen runs on borrowed money, and therefore borrowed time. that brings us back to the question of just what these billions upon billions of dollars have been used for. sadly, everybody knows that while the country was left locked in a cycle of borrow-to-survive and borrow-to-repay, a lot of people that signed on the dotted line also grew very rich in the years that the debt balloon was inflated. so, to cut a very long and unfortunate story short, the debt piled on, the country grew poorer, a few political families became very rich, and the rest of the people must now pay for it, figuratively as well as literally, for a number of generations. sooner or later, the government will be forced to give infrastructure the kind of fiscal attention that it needs even after all the blessings that have come with the china pakistan economic corridor (CPEC). but, again, before that it would have to find ways to create some additional fiscal space. yet there no easy way to expand its list of available options. and just when the good news about the G20 debt moratorium came after the bad news of the pandemic and the lockdowns, some disturbing news also came about some of the world top ratings agencies downgrading the sovereign ratings of some of the countries that availed the facility. that is very bad news for pakistan, of course, since we are also in line for it. no doubt the government understands very well that the only thing standing between long-term survival and possible sovereign default somewhere down the road is precisely the ability to build enough infrastructure to fuel growth and improve revenue in time. such things take much time, though, so the sooner the official machinery springs into action the better."

In defence of SBP bill,2021-03-28,Business Recorder,"There is quite a stir in the media and policy circles on the proposed amendments in the SBP law. Journalists and economists jumped on the bandwagon and speculated on widely circulated snippets of what was reportedly an old draft. Others have expressed resentment over the hush-hush nature of the process as rumor mills suggest that the amendments may be enacted through a presidential ordinance as a prior condition of the IMF board approval. Others are too critical on the supposed enhanced autonomy of the State Bank. Many sane voices have also questioned the downgrading of growth objective of the central bank.Based on channel checks, and off the record discussions with stakeholders, this article presents SBP's perspective, keeping in mind established international best practices. But first, some context setting is imperative to understand the process followed thus far.SBP's internal team has been working on the amendments since 2015. The team has gone through legislation of 95 central banks' and released a draft based on local context and international best practices. At the start of 2020, SBP sent first draft to the IMF for comments. After incorporating (not all) changes proposed by the IMF, the draft was sent to the Ministry of Finance (MoF) in April 2020. Back and forth consultations continued and finally a draft was approved by the federal cabinet this month. In between, over a dozen drafts were prepared, while snippets from only one of them (possibly redundant) draft are circulating on the social media. IMF's condition was for the draft to be submitted in parliament. That will happen once the National Assembly is in session again. Then, the process of parliamentary debate will take place before the law is amended. This implies the process was not carried out in haste and is far from concluded. The problem is in the strategic communication by MoF. The draft bill is still not made public which led to a mad rush of speculation in the print and electronic media. Finally, the ministry posted a deck of slides on the proposed amendments on its website earlier during the week. This writer strongly urges the ministry to release the full draft version for a wider debate.The amendments sought intend to make SBP more autonomous and to provide it with a clear mandate, a welcome move. In the past, SBP had often remained under the thumb of MoF. Politically-motivated monetary and exchange rate policies were adopted to create a perception of better economic picture before successive general elections. The 2008 and 2018 crises are manifestation of undue political interferences by the outgoing governments at the time. By taking the central bank out of the control of finance ministry, a similar crisis can hopefully be avoided in the future. If that is to happen, there is a fair chance for Pakistan to come out of the rut of frequent boom and bust cycles.The most far-reaching amendment, then of course, relates to the redefining of SBP's mandate. Existing objectives are vague and widely interpreted to mean that price stability and growth are dual and equally important objectives for the central bank. It is now being proposed that domestic price stability be made the primary objective, with secondary objective of stability of financial system. Tertiary objective is to support government policies that foster economic development. Many commentators are of the view that growth should remain a joint primary objective. Over the past few decades, Pakistan's long-term growth has been on a secular decline. In between, there were periods of high inflation. This means that the twin focused objectives as defined currently are not working out. It may be high time to try out things differently and adopt ways that have been successful elsewhere across the world. Global literature as well as Pakistan's own history suggests that high growth is hard to achieve in a high inflationary environment. Moreover, inflation is a broad form of tax which hits the poor the worst. In that sense, it may be argued that price stability is a far more important objective to achieve economic well-being of a nation as a whole. And if that policy does not work, the parliament reserves the right to revise the Act again in future and make growth top priority again for the SBP. Then there was confusion over the continuation of SBP's refinance facilities. In the proposed amendment (slides deck), SBP refinancing schemes to support access to credit in underserved sectors is still permissible. In fact, the spectrum of refinancing facilities will expand if the amendments are enacted. Many central banks, after 2008 global financial crises, now rely on quantitative easing. It is hoped that the bank's scope in that respect shall be enhanced. However, quasi-fiscal operations shall be discontinued. Interestingly, currently SBP is not operating any quasi-fiscal schemes.In the past, many existing refinance schemes operating since the 1970s were misused. Influential business groups lobby politicians to not let these go. Now, the SBP will have a better grip on these schemes and will be able to decouple the political economy from the equation. Such schemes are not supposed to be under central bank's ambit anyway. A better mechanism is to have effective development finance institutions (DFIs) - just as was the case in Pakistan during the 1960s. The government should work to develop DFIs and expedite operationalization of EXIM Bank. Once these are in place, the SBP may slowly taper off its refinancing facilities over time.Still others fear compromise of national economic sovereignty due to end of direct government borrowing. It is pertinent to note that in the existing Act (after last amendment in 2015), the government borrowing from SBP is net zero on quarterly basis. Hence, the new change will have limited impact. In principle, the government borrowing from central bank is inflationary in nature and eliminating it from legal framework will ensure that finance ministry is forced to exercise self-discipline in its budget-making and resource allocations. However, there should be some room for direct government borrowing in the event of natural calamities or emergencies. For instance, the Bank of England provided direct lending to the government in response to Covid-19. Nonetheless, indirect borrowing (through reverse open market operations) by government from SBP via commercial banks will continue. This is a better (though more expensive) mechanism where the risk is being transferred from central bank to commercial banking system, and the latter charges incremental spread for assuming that risk. The other criticism is on enhanced autonomy for SBP. What is wrong with the autonomy when it comes with better accountability? Achieving autonomy is key to taking the SBP out of finance ministry's control. In the past, there were incidents when the Governor had to obtain permission from Finance Minister for foreign travel and other petty issues. Then, the Governor used to play second fiddle in the Monetary and Fiscal Coordination Board. The ministry is the biggest buyer of banking system credit, while monetary policy and financial stability fall under the exclusive domain of the SBP. There is a clear conflict of interest if a Finance Minister drives the agenda on either of those accounts. In the past, Finance Ministers had clear influence over policy rate and exchange rate, leading to politically-motivated decision-making. SBP's foreign exchange reserves were wasted to keep currency at the desired level. Currency printing, low interest rate, and an overvalued exchange rate contributed to numerous external account crises. Pakistan had to go to the IMF and forced to take tough actions. Each time, a new government came to power during the last two decades - first in 2008 and then in 2018, interest rates had to be raised to double digits along with massive currency devaluation. Such volatility in the price of money stems the flow of economic growth. Now the SBP can smoothen these adjustments to not let any bigger crisis to emerge. Another item which has caused a lot of uproar in mainstream media is that SBP Governor and other key officials of the central bank shall not be investigated by NAB, FIA or other authorities without prior consent of the board. Ironically, those critical of this proposal were until recently insisting that bureaucracy is not taking decisions due to fear of NAB and others. Maybe these folks should appreciate that finally, at least the SBP shall work freely without any fear of undue victimization. However, this does not imply that the SBP shall face no accountability over its decision-making. It cannot be allowed to become a state within a state. Going forward, the accountability mechanism is well-defined, with checks and balances. The Governor is appointed by the President, and this is not proposed to change. In case of the Deputy Governor, the federal government will appoint one (out of a panel of three recommended by the Governor), following consultations with the Finance Minister. There will be three Deputy Governors.These four officials (Governor and his or her three deputies) will be the most important and powerful people in the SBP. All the key appointments are in hands of the government. Finance Minister will have a say in the shortlisting of Deputy Governors.In case of non-executive directors on the SBP board, these will also be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the government (and not of the Governor or of the SBP board). However, finance secretary will no longer be a member of the board. For external members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), the federal government will make appointments on the recommendation of the board -this is same as in the existing law.The terms of Governor, his deputies, board and MPC members will be of five years, with an option for a second term renewal. In most of these cases, the existing term is of three years. That is again in line with best international practices and to insulate these appointments from the election cycle to mitigate the risk of politically driven appointments. Another important aspect missed by many commentators is the role of the Executive Committee. The committee will comprise the Governor, Deputy Governors, executive directors, and other officials. Here, the voting power will be with the Governor and the Deputy Governors, with each official having one, equally weighted vote. The committee will make decisions regarding bank's core functions and other matters. In this committee, the powers of the Governor will be the same as his deputies. The deputies are appointed by the federal government and based on the names proposed after consultation with the finance ministry. All of this suggests that the Governor will not have absolute power. The office of Governor is accountable to the parliament in the same way as prevalent in many economies. It is unfortunate how many reputed economists are actively imagining ""a state within a state"" or pushing for conspiracy theories. The proposed amendments are in an Act of Parliament, which can be changed again through a simple majority. The existing system has clearly not yielded desired results. There may be little harm in doing things differently. Moreover, the de jure autonomy may take years before becoming de facto. Even then, if the new system leaves us worse off than before, subsequent legislatures can reverse those changes.The confusion and public concerns over the proposed bill may persist even after its passage from the parliament. The best way of addressing these concerns is to further enhance parliamentary oversight of central bank's operations. That may not be a big trade-off for an independent and autonomous SBP, free from influence of the executive branch.(The writer is the head of BR Research.

"Budget proposals for 2021-22: PRGMEA calls for steps to promote industrialization, enhance exports",2021-03-28,Business Recorder,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PRGMEA) has called for steps to promote industrialization and enhance exports in its budget proposals for 2021-22. PRGMEA vice-chairman Adeeb Iqbal urged the government to make the next budget business-friendly, lower cost of production, allow early refunds and relax import policy for industrial raw material.He said the GSP Plus status is a golden opportunity, which exporters could exploit to meet the export target. The value-added textile sector has been the main driver of the economy for the last 50 years in terms of foreign currency earnings and jobs creation.In its budget recommendations, PRGMEA sought revival of statutory regulatory order (SRO) 1125 in its true shape, reintroducing the system of no payment no refund of sales tax for the five export-oriented sectors of textile, leather, carpets, surgical and sports goods for a year.All stuck up claims of exporters' customs rebates and sales tax rebates should be released, it said. The apparel industry should be allowed to import fabric under SRO 492 scheme instead of the Duty and Tax Remission Scheme (DTRE) as the country's weaving industry is unable to fulfill the demands of fashion wear with foreign buyers demanding new garments based on G-3, G4 and technical fabric material. The DTRE is quite complicated and only limited exporters can avail of imports under that facility while 97 percent of small and medium enterprises can be helped under SRO 492, which was in force earlier, it said.Adeeb Iqbal also proposed that cotton yarn and fabric, the major raw material of the apparel sector, should be exempted from all duties and taxes to encourage value addition. PRGMEA suggested that all taxes and duties on import of polyester staple fibre, including anti-dumping duty, should be abolished to reduce the cost of production to compete in the market.Accusing government agencies of harassing the textile industry, he said social security and other taxes should be merged and deducted at the source. There is no alternative industry or service sector other than textile that has the potential to benefit the economy with foreign currency earnings and new job creation. The PRGMEA North zone chief said that close consultation with stakeholders could help determine measures for ensuring viability and competitiveness in the international market. He also stressed the need for enhancing the product lines of exports and for that purpose some incentives should also be announced by the government.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021","budget proposals for 2021-22 PRGMEA calls for steps to promote industrialization, enhance exports LAHORE the pakistan readymade garments manufacturers and exporters association (PRGMEA) has called for steps to promote industrialization and enhance exports in its budget proposals for 2021-22.

Afghanistan: Pakistan calls for withdrawal of foreign troops,2021-03-28,Business Recorder,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has called for an orderly and responsible withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, fearing that a precipitous withdrawal may create a vacuum for ""spoilers"" amid Taliban's warning to the United States against missing the deadline of May 01, 2021 - the agreed upon time limit for American forces to leave the country under Qatar peace deal.The Foreign Office is yet to give official response on the Taliban's strongly-worded statement on Saturday, in which the armed group has warned of increased attacks in case the foreign troops failed to leave Afghanistan by May 01 in line with the US-Taliban peace agreement.A senior government official said that Pakistan believes that it is critical that the progress on the implementation of the peace agreement is maintained and further built upon in order to achieve its stated objectives of a peaceful political settlement in Afghanistan.""As for the withdrawal of the US troops, Pakistan supports orderly and responsible withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan as a precipitous withdrawal would create a vacuum for spoilers,"" he asserted.He stated that Pakistan had consistently maintained that there was no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan and negotiations were the only way forward.""All sides must work together for an inclusive, broad-based and comprehensive political settlement,"" he added.The Taliban, on Saturday, issued a statement in response of US President Joe Biden's recent statement that some 2,500 American troops could still be in Afghanistan after May 1, saying: ""It's going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline.""""If, God forbid, all foreign troops [do] not withdraw from Afghanistan on the specified date in line with the Doha agreement, undoubtedly it will be considered a violation of the accord by America for which it shall be held liable and which shall also harm its international standing.

Indo-Pak peace prospects suddenly brighten,2021-03-28,Business Recorder,"EDITORIAL: Tensions between Pakistan and India seem to be easing somewhat. In a surprise development last month, the two countries directors general of military operations (DGMOs) held a meeting in a ""cordial atmosphere"" and announced an agreement ""for strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the LoC and all other sectors, with effect from midnight 24/25 February"". The statement also contained signs of a thaw in bilateral relations as it said ""in the interest of achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace, the two DGMOs agreed to address each other's core issues/concerns which have the propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence"". Although some on this side insisted the statement should to be read within the context of ceasefire violations, New Delhi expressed its desire to have ""normal neighbourly relations"" with Pakistan. Press reports emanating from India now say Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi is likely to meet his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on the sidelines of the upcoming ""Heart of Asia"" conference in Tajikistan's capital Dushanbe. According to these reports, the two sides are to discuss the Saarc summit - which has remained in abeyance since 2016 due to Pak-India tensions - to be held in Islamabad; and that there is a strong chance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's participation in it. They are also to discuss reinstatement, at the earliest, of high commissioners in both the countries. Given the hostility that has characterized Modi government's policy towards this country, there surely is more to these developments than meets the eye. At least three good reasons suggest the Biden administration may have (through intermediaries reportedly the UAE) nudged PM Modi to improve relations with Pakistan. One, of course, is that the US needs Pakistan's help to end its longest war in Afghanistan. Secondly, while the US strategists see India as a counterweight to China, they do not want the country to be dragged down by its ceaseless conflict with Pakistan. On its part, India is happy to get a seat at the high table as a partner in the US' Indo-Pacific strategy. Third, President Joe Biden may be finding it difficult to ignore the humanitarian crisis in the Illegally Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, given that during his election campaign he had expressed concern over human rights violations. Also, in a policy paper titled ""Joe Biden's agenda for Muslim American community"" he had decried the Citizens Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens as being inconsistent with the country's long-standing tradition of secularism and with sustaining a multi-ethnic and multi-religious democracy.Jammu and Kashmir being the core issue of Pak-India conflict, Islamabad had decided to downgrade diplomatic ties on August 7, 2019, two days after New Delhi scrapped article 370 of its constitution that gave special status to the disputed region. In a usual tit-for-tat reaction, India had recalled its envoy to this country.  Resumption of a meaningful dialogue process, therefore, is contingent upon resolution of the situation in occupied Kashmir. For a start, India must end the military siege; stop human rights violations and abuses; free all illegally detained Kashmiris, and repeal the new domicile and property laws aimed at changing the disputed region's demographic complexion. Its ultra-Hindu nationalist prime minister is not expected to easily agree to any proposal for dismantling the anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan hostility structure he has built his entire political career on. Still, that country's influential friends, in particular the US, can play a role in promoting a substantive peace dialogue between the two nuclear-armed nations. They need to do that for the sake of peace and stability of this region, which is in their own interest.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021","Indo-Pak peace prospects suddenly brighten EDITORIAL tensions between pakistan and india seem to be easing somewhat. in a surprise development last month, the two countries directors general of military operations (DGMOs) held a meeting in a ""cordial atmosphere"" and announced an agreement ""for strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the LoC and all other sectors, with effect from midnight 24/25 february"". the statement also contained signs of a thaw in bilateral relations as it said ""in the interest of achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace, the two DGMOs agreed to address each other core issues/concerns which have the propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence"". although some on this side insisted the statement should to be read within the context of ceasefire violations, new delhi expressed its desire to have ""normal neighbourly relations"" with pakistan. press reports emanating from india now say foreign minister shah mehmood qureshi is likely to meet his indian counterpart S jaishankar on the sidelines of the upcoming ""heart of asia"" conference in tajikistan capital dushanbe. according to these reports, the two sides are to discuss the saarc summit - which has remained in abeyance since 2016 due to Pak-India tensions - to be held in islamabad and that there is a strong chance of prime minister narendra modi participation in it. they are also to discuss reinstatement, at the earliest, of high commissioners in both the countries. given the hostility that has characterized modi government policy towards this country, there surely is more to these developments than meets the eye. at least three good reasons suggest the biden administration may have (through intermediaries reportedly the UAE) nudged PM modi to improve relations with pakistan. one, of course, is that the US needs pakistan help to end its longest war in afghanistan. secondly, while the US strategists see india as a counterweight to china, they do not want the country to be dragged down by its ceaseless conflict with pakistan. on its part, india is happy to get a seat at the high table as a partner in the US' Indo-Pacific strategy. third, president joe biden may be finding it difficult to ignore the humanitarian crisis in the illegally indian occupied jammu and kashmir, given that during his election campaign he had expressed concern over human rights violations. also, in a policy paper titled ""joe biden agenda for muslim american community"" he had decried the citizens amendment act and the national register of citizens as being inconsistent with the country long-standing tradition of secularism and with sustaining a multi-ethnic and multi-religious democracy.jammu and kashmir being the core issue of Pak-India conflict, islamabad had decided to downgrade diplomatic ties on august 7, 2019, two days after new delhi scrapped article 370 of its constitution that gave special status to the disputed region. in a usual tit-for-tat reaction, india had recalled its envoy to this country. resumption of a meaningful dialogue process, therefore, is contingent upon resolution of the situation in occupied kashmir. for a start, india must end the military siege stop human rights violations and abuses free all illegally detained kashmiris, and repeal the new domicile and property laws aimed at changing the disputed region demographic complexion. its ultra-Hindu nationalist prime minister is not expected to easily agree to any proposal for dismantling the anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan hostility structure he has built his entire political career on. still, that country influential friends, in particular the US, can play a role in promoting a substantive peace dialogue between the two nuclear-armed nations. they need to do that for the sake of peace and stability of this region, which is in their own interest."
Why has Pakistan not produced any Covid-19 vaccines?,2021-03-28,Dawn,"COVID-19 brought the world to its knees. The Covid vaccine has been the most sought-after product. However, as governments around the world rush to vaccinate their citizens, some aspects need deliberation and clarity. For instance, what explains the short supply of vaccines? And thereÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s the lesser discussed (but very important) aspect of non-production of vaccines in Pakistan.A lot of what is taking place has economics at its core. First, the all-important question of vaccine supply. Despite the significant price incentive at present, why canÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t pharma companies ramp up production to address the huge supply-demand gap?Vaccine production is a complex process. It requires research worth millions of dollars. Then there is the need to set up production facilities to precise specifications (eg stainless steel bio-reactors), arrange for needed raw materials (tubing, plastic bags, etc), and finding relevant human capital. In short, itÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s an ives are in place. Even with all the facilities, ramping up production in the short run is very difficult because certain requirements can be difficult to meet.Two recent examples illustrate this well. The Serum Institute of India (SII), which is the worldÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s largest vaccine producer, hurriedly set up a new facility last year to increase production, but it caught fire. Similarly, Moderna had to discontinue production at a facility in Belgium because it couldnÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t meet the quality criteria.Why is there no domestically produced vaccine, or even a semblance of an effort to produce it?Supply constraints are another factor. The head of SII recently complained of the US ban on raw material exports (such as specialised bags, which the US wants to be available for domestic production first, aka Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½vaccine nationalismÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½). There are other raw material shortages too (cell culture media, single-use tubing, specialised chemicÃ½Ã½Ã½s difficult to meet added demand in the short run.Another way to ramp up production would be for firms with underutilised infrastructure to share facilities with vaccine-producing firms. Two main issues emerge here: firms would be reluctant to share vaccine formulation (it is expensive intellectual property acquired after substantial investment) and facilities may not be of the same quality.Briefly, pushing present infrastructure to produce more can have negative repercussions, which explains, to a great extent, why thereÃ½Ã½Ã½s a substantial difference between the supply and demand of vaccines.An important aspect is the funding of vaccines by governments. The US, for example, has been funding vaccine research since the 1960s. The mRNA technology (used in Moderna and Pfizer vaccines) came about, partly, due to $150 million grant to pharma firms by the Obama administration. Similarly, Russian Sputnik vaccine research was financially supported by MoscowÃ½Ã½Ã½s health agency.Why publicly fund research into vaccines? As Covid-19 and historic episodes like the Spanish flu and bubonic plague (Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½black deathÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½) aptly demonstrated, viruses have the potential to bring the world to its knees, causing massive financial and economic losses plus utter misery. It is perfectly sensible and logical to pre-empt such a catastrophe. Since viruses also mutate over time, it requires constant research plus investment in infrastructure, which in turn requires extensive financial resources. Pharma firms will only be willing to devote the required resources if there is a good demand for vaccines. In a manner of speaking, government support ameliorates fears of investment going to waste. ItÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s a win-win situation for both the industry and government: companies get much-needed financial support to lessen uncertainty, while the government gets the vaccines it requires for public welfare.Now we come to another very important topic. In Pakistan, not a single vaccine of anyomestically produced vaccine, or even a semblance of an effort to produce it? In our immediate neighbourhood, India has the worldÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s leading producers such as SII (Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ known locally as Covishield Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ and Covaxin), Bharat BioTec (Covaxin, CoraVax), Biological E (Johnson & Johnson), Zydus Cadila (ZyCov-D), Hetero BioPharma (Sputnik V) and Dr ReddyÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s Lab (Sputnik V). SII, aside from providing millions of Covid-19 doses within India, is in commercially contracted to providing 900 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine and 145m doses of Novavax globally. While exports are held up at the moment, imagine the scale of Indian vaccine production with the local authorities aiming to administer 600m doses within seven months, meaning about 85m doses a month.As stated, pharma firms are incentivised to take up vaccine and drug research through public financial support. Contrast this to PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ytral Research Fund or CRF) since 1976, equivalent to one per cent of its gross sales. Put another way, the governmentÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s message to the industry is: leave research to us and just pay for it. While the industry has obliged, the government has utterly failed. There is little or zero research to show for. Where did all that money since 1976 go? Officials remain tightlipped. What we do know is that there is not a single FDA-approved lab (international gold standard) nor any international-level infrastructure established through public expense.The CRF is only one example of adverse regulations that dis-incentivises research. For example, successive governments have been obsessed with regulated drug prices that have led to many adverse outcomes (Indian government did away with this fascination in the 1980s, following which the industry really took off). Imagine that from 2001-2013, drug prices were Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½frozenÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ while production costs went thro a regular feature and many leading multinational firms have packed up and left Pakistan. Similarly, India is earning $34 billion from Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½toll manufacturingÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ in the pharma industry, while our government doesnÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t allow it, or only to a limited extent.Thus, to put it briefly, there is complete absence of right incentives to produce vaccines in Pakistan. Given what the world and Pakistan has been through, likely effects of any future pandemic, and the adverse outcomes of our regulations, itÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s time to get our policies right in terms of pharmaceutical industry.The writer is an economist and Research Fe","why has pakistan not produced any Covid-19 vaccines?

Tariff hike: some caveats and reform proposals,2021-03-29,Tribune,"Without reforms and better efficiency, tariff hike may be counter-productive
ISLAMABAD:
 
 The government has announced plans to increase  power tariff  by Rs5.65 per unit, an estimated 40% increase. Gas utilities have asked for similar or even higher increase in their tariffs. 
 In this space, we will examine the non-tariff options to deal with problems of rising cost and circular debt, which has forced the government to propose the increase in power tariff. Over-capacity and high cost agreements will have a long shadow over the current and future tariff issues. However, reforms are overdue. Without undertaking reforms and increasing efficiency, the tariff hike alone may prove to be counter-productive. 
 It would be a political and economic risk to try to eke out all circular debt from  consumers . As a rule, any capacity payments under capacity utilisation of 60-66% cannot be passed on to consumers, until the economy starts growing at a pace of 7% or so. 
 To the extent of under-utilisation of capacity, ways and means would have to be found to finance part of its adjustment through refinancing, debt rescheduling and passing some burden to provinces. Some improvements in capacity utilisation should be possible by removing transmission and distribution (T&D) constraints as well. 
 Reduce power tariff, electricity demand will  increase . This is the most controversial yet a subject with great potential. This is reverse of the increase in power tariff. 
 If this is not true for the residential consumers, it should be true for the commercial and industrial sectors. By increasing demand and thus increasing capacity utilisation, the unit cost will decrease with its impact on circular debt. 
 Had serious work been done on this aspect, perhaps, the IMF would have been less relentless in pursuing its demand for a large tariff increase. The recent IPP agreement is a welcome step. These concessions are, however, for the longer term benefit and do not help bridge the current revenue shortfall. 
 Finally, Nepra should fast track institutionalising these adjustments into a permanent framework. Main issues are revised rates of return on equity (ROE) at 12%, interest rates and risk margins. 
 It is highly inequitable that G2G projects, which normally enjoy sovereign guarantees, have the same return and debt terms as given to the normal commercial contracts, which face higher risks. Softer lending rates should be required for G2G projects in which normally capital expenditure (capex) is higher due to the lack of competition. We are suffering from a capacity glut. The least that can be done is to advance the schedule of new projects. 
 Distribution firms 
 Putting the distribution companies (DISCOs) right should be on top of the agenda along with doing away with the inefficient generation companies (Gencos). On the DISCOs and T&D side, major improvements and reforms are required, which is almost half of the problem. 
 T&D losses are high and almost stagnant at 18.3%. There is an issue of receivables of around Rs1 trillion as well, although, allegedly, receivables are exaggerated to reduce losses and enhance the balance sheet appearance. 
 Many reforms have been discussed and are overdue like reducing the geographical size of loss-making companies like Pesco and Mepco. Privatisation, either as leasing, management transfer or outright sale has been discussed for a long time. Time has arrived to implement any viable scheme. 
 Unfortunately, the revival of Pakistan Electric Power Company (Pepco) has been put off. Pepco could have provided the much-needed intermediary layer for a technical and management role, which is currently occupied by the ministerial bureaucracy. 
 Much hope is being tied to the new independent boards, which are neither independent nor effective. 
 Two hours of meetings of a motley crowd of experts and vested interests cannot possibly replace an effective supervisory role that can be offered by Pepco or give it a new and better name with enhanced role to include Gencos and a strong technical component. 
 There are some technical issues as well, which require immediate attention for improving DISCOsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ performance and reducing theft. 
 Smart distribution transformers (DT), with smart meters installed on DTs, have been discussed, offering tremendous efficiency improvement opportunities at a smaller cost than installing smart meters at consumer prices, as proposed by the Asian Development Bank. 
 They will provide an electricity accounting framework on geographically locating theft and losses to manageably smaller areas covered by DTs. K-Electric has done it and is reaping its benefits. USAID has already provided a nucleus through its pilot projects at Mepco and Pesco, which being high-loss companies should have been selected in the first place instead of Lesco and Iesco. 
 With the installation of two capital-intensive nuclear power plants of 1,100 megawatts each, there should be some action on shutting down the inefficient Gencos. 
 Ultimately, the open market and competition will open the doors for cheaper gas and electricity, it is argued by many. However, it is a long-term and time-taking issue. 
 Competition 
 Nepra is working on the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM), which has many inadequacies and issues. With or without CTBCM, there should be no constraints on introducing wires-only model in DISCOs. This will simplify complications of privatisation. 
 Some competition can be introduced, without waiting for CTBCM and its implementation, under solicited bidding and by doing away with unsolicited projects, which are partly a source of many vices. 
 There has always been a fear in going for competition. Had this not been the case, our plight could have been better. 
 Similarly, all talk of replacing ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœtake and payÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â instead of the current ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœtake or payÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â is simplistic. Take and pay works in competitive markets where the price is determined by competition. Decreasing capacity utilisation from 80% to 60-66% under the take-and-pay model has no practical cost reduction impact. 
 Reforms are due in the Integrated Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP). The plan has been made under three assumptions of economic growth of 4-7%. Current growth rate is 3% and is likely to remain low due to the Covid debt and other issues. 
 Despite these changes, project approval continues to be uninfluenced. Its time horizon should be reduced to 10 years and yearly adjustments should be made in a 10-year rolling plan. Poor should be our focus and priority in drawing any financial scheme. There is a case for introducing direct transfer of power and gas subsidies to the poor consumers. This can be introduced under the Ehsaas programme and financed under the general budget and debt. 
 It may have acceptability from the IFIs and may help in reducing the proposed increase. There are other proposals of linking tariff subsidies to localities and plot sizes rather than consumption alone. It may add complexity but may release some resources for passing them to the poor.

A review of public procurement,2021-03-29,Tribune,"Pakistan can save billions of dollars annually by optimising procurement process
ISLAMABAD:
 
 One of the most common terms which one hears in the public sector is ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœPPRA rulesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â. This article makes a brief review of procurement dynamics of PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s public sector and the associated governance structure including the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules. 
 A developing country like  Pakistan  annually spends around 20% of gross domestic product (GDP), or $60 billion in our case, through this medium. This includes approximately 90% budget of public sector enterprises (PSEs). It necessitates that the associated governance structure should be foolproof and user-friendly. However, it is a matter of concern that in the public sector, PPRA rules are widely taken as an unpleasant challenge. Probably, the announcement of governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s intention to grant PSEs exemption from the rules is driven by this factor. 
 This seems akin to the solution generally presented to cope with  poor performance  of the PSEs, ie privatisation, though it is a well-known fact that earnings of a company are only linked with how it is governed. Large and efficient public sectors have proven the efficacy of this approach in many countries such as Norway, Singapore, China, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states, etc. Issues pertaining to public procurement can similarly be sorted out by augmenting the capacity of governance structure and procuring agencies. Multiple sources indicate that Pakistan can save at least $18 billion annually by optimising its public procurement. This amply highlights that the supply chain has become a highly specialised field and requires corresponding level of professional capacity for its management in addition to a robust governance structure. Capacity deficiency results in indecisiveness or ill-informed decisions. 
 Governance structure 
 In search for answers for the above issues I went through the PPRA website and the pertaining governance structures and associated data of various countries including a few useful video lectures. The main observations made during the review are summarised below: 
 One, the last detailed annual report which I could access on the PPRA website is a few years old. Also, according to some sources, PPRA appears to be substantially understaffed vis-a-vis its scope of responsibilities. In the given backdrop, its functioning can be improved with due support and attention. 
 Two, the PPRA board is supposed to comprise 10 members, but positions of three private members seem to be vacant since long. Moreover, their role gets diluted when the PPRA ordinance says five members can complete the quorum. 
 Three, a report available on the PPRA website titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœNational Procurement StrategyÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â, produced a few years ago, highlights the requirement of an impartial forum for dealing with grievances, conflict of interest of board members, the regulatory ambit of PPRA, lack of a well-defined yardstick for private members, requirement of representation in the board for other stakeholders such as the private sector, civil society, etc and the need for a professional managing director. The report notes ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœthe current regime does not assign weightage to quality even in cases where quality is critical to the objective of procurement.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â 
 Also highlighted in the report, the conflicted nature of existing grievance redressing mechanism, ie in-house committees, proves to be an impediment to conflict resolution. Thus, serious conflicts mostly end up in courts, which results in undue delay. This systemic gap frequently results in frivolous issues getting complicated. Serious post-contract award conflicts mostly end up in courts, whose roots may even be traced back to the omissions committed much earlier in the chain of events, but not really to the deployment of PPRA rules. 
 The above factors lead to higher costs because the multiple unknowns compel bidders as well as procuring agencies to prepare their bids and tenders conservatively. The resultant atmosphere discourages innovation and entrepreneurship with all concerned taking the most conservative or safe positions since inception, thus leaving no room for informed discretion, which, otherwise, derives all decision-making in the corporate environment. Of course, the capacity issues of procuring agencies also contribute in this regard. 
 A study of the government of Pakistan, World Bank, European Commission, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and UK Department of International Development (DFID) summarises the situation as follows: ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThroughout the government, there is a dearth of skills in procurement and contract administration ranging from the development of policy to the management of function.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â 
 What is to be done? 
 Exempting the PSEs from PPRA rules may not help. Instead, we need to augment the overall governance structure along with the capacity of procuring agencies. Some of the required steps can be as follows: 
 One, the PPRA needs to be provided with an advisory board of high-level supply chain management (SCM) experts for professional guidance. It may preferably be a statutory institution. Two, all the outstanding action points of the above-mentioned strategy prepared by the PPRA may be implemented on priority. 
 Three, most of the developed countries have facilitated conflict resolution by integrating specialised institutions such as the public procurement ombudsman, procurement tribunals/ courts as well as the regulatory bodies concerned. 
 At least, 153 countries provide the facility of an independent administrative review. Though 89 charge a fee for it, it saves considerable time and money. For instance, in a majority of OECD countries, such decisions take only around 30 days. We need to consider a similar institution for the given objective. 
 Four, the critical gap in the bid evaluation criteria, driven by the slogan of ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœtechnically acceptable and commercially lowestÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â, appears to have been bridged vide a recent revision in PPRA rules by incorporating the concept of ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœmost advantageous bidÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â. Adopting the same in its true spirit may require the training of all stakeholders. Five, the PPRA may consider introducing regulations for inventory management, centralised inventories and framework contracts for common use items. Effective management of this aspect can lead to huge savings. 
 Similarly, it may also consider incorporating dedicated rules for engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts. Six, the PPRA needs to develop professional linkages with the corresponding procuring authorities of some OECD countries. Seven, capacity mapping of the procuring agencies should be carried out, especially with respect to high-value tendering, bid evaluation and contracting, inventory management, contract management, problem solving and decision-making. Gaps identified in mapping may be bridged on priority. 
 In view of the above, it can be concluded that we need to take a holistic view to deal with snags in public procurement. By focusing on the issue along above lines, we can effectively fill the relevant gaps, which will obviate the need for any new regime. A radical change may, instead, cause repercussions which may take a long time to disappear.

The dupatta, fluttering in the air, wins all, beguiling in its multicolored beauty when, in reality, it wields immense power.One had assumed, of course, that with the world in the throes of a pandemic and budgets getting slashed considerably, the market for designer lawn in Pakistan would recede into the shadows. Where would women wear these elaborate jigsaw puzzles, where embroidery meets cotton, organza and chiffon, with a dash of bling added in for effect?With one lawn brand following the other relentlessly in launches and queues of buyers forming outside retail stores, the answer seems to be that they will be wearing them everywhere. The coronavirus pandemic may still be at large but a sizable contingent of the country has refused to acknowledge ithey contract it, and lavish, crowded parties continue to rule the social circuit. The ladies, then, will be wearing their designer lawn when they eschew SOPs, and prepare for a high-flying weekend.Catering to this very lucrative market, is an extensive gamut of lawn brands.

In the midst of a pandemic, the prices seem even more implausible. The fact that many of the brands are still hauling in sales is indicative of the extreme dichotomy in finances that exists within Pakistan.The price hike, says designer Safinaz Munir of Sana Safinaz, is a result of rising production costs and could not be avoided.

People are willing to spend a bit more because they know that the fabric is of great quality, there is an identifiable design signature and, at least in our case, the embroideries are all part of the suit and donÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t have to be appliqued tediously.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Similarly, Sana Safinaz lawn aficionados are willing to pay around a thousand or two more than what they paid last year for the brandÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s distinctive designs.

Every year, entire collections are dedicated to embroidered necklines and trimmings and pretty prints that are strictly floral because most of the masses have religious reservations against wearing clothes that have faces on them. According to Safinaz, the innovations are in the details.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½We try to bring in new elements into every lawn collection,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ she says. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Women love wearing luxurious dupattas and so, we often place a focus on them. This year, we have dupattas worked with kamdani, puff prints and zari borders. The dupattas can be used later with other suits and the chiffon ones can even be dyed another colour! On some of the shirts, weÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ve employed crewel embroidery and 3-D embellishments tins her perspective: Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½You canÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t fool the customer with a substandard product. Elan lawn is very popular because weÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ve always been very particular about using quality fabrics and mixing them with the elaborate embroideries that are now considered the brandÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s highpoints.

I donÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t think that net and organza dupattas are comfortable in the summer, so instead the collection features beautiful silk and voile dupattas.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Elan Elan, also, has a sister brand, Zaha, which dabbles with less pricey, slightly less elaborate lawn. This constitutes as day-wear. Similarly, designer Zainab Chottani has diversified this year to bring out two lawn collections: the pricier Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½titched suits, from the high-priced Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½festiveÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ designs to more basic lawns for daily-wear.The copycat cultureHowever, even more affordable lawn brands cannot beat the pricing that is the result of the lawn plagiarism trade running rampant in local marketplaces. Small kiosks in popular markets, such as LahoreÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s Liberty and Aashiana in Karachi, are stacked high with designer lawn replicas at a fraction of the originalÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s price. From the chiffon dupatta to the embroidered border, every design detail may get replicated into an inferior version. Even the packaging may seem the same, boxes and plastic bags proudly declaring the original brand name!Back in 2015, when designer Faraz Manan would bring out seasonal lawn collections, some of his designs were somehow leaked prior to their official release. Counterfeits were created with great efficiency and were released into the market on the same day as the original laways end up buying it. Nevertheless, seeing a substandard copy at a mall of your brand new lawn suit must diminish some of the excitement of wearing the design.Given that lawn designers have now become savvier, offering regular sales in order to draw the customer away from copycats, does plagiarism still hurt luxury lawn sales?Sana Safinaz Asim Jofa, one of the most copied brands in the market, observes, Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½I donÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t think that it hurts as much as it used to. In my 11 yearsÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ experience of creating designer lawn, I have noticed that customers that buy the original will always choose to do so. Over time, I have also seen a greater diversification between people who buy the original and those who opt for copies. They are unlikely to be moving in the same social circles so, usually, my customer wonÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t be bothered by the copies at all.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Also, itÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s important to keep mo be marketing a new collection.

Quite ingenious!TurkistanThe marketing of lawn has also always been a case study all on its own. Before relations soured with India, Bollywood actresses were often enlisted to model collections Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ Faraz MananÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s campaigns with Kareena Kapoor come to mind. Once India was ruled out, the focus quickly zeroed in on local actresses who continue to be the faces for collections Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ sometimes to the point of ubiquity.Ayeza Khan, for instance, is possibly the face of more than five lawn collections this year. The part from the celebrity circus, brands have also often opted to shoot their collections in exotic foreign locations. Before the coronavirus pandemic came along, this meant that a lawn catalogue could be a veritable travelogue, traversing the nooks of European towns, cosmopolitan cities and tropical isles. This year, though, it meant that many of PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s lawn moguls had the same bright idea: of shooting in Turkey, one of the few countries open for travel during the pandemic.From Zainab Chottani to Elan, Maria B. and a host of lesser known brands, Turkey was the location du jour. Some of the shoots were artistically done, sweeping over scenery in lesser known parts of the country. Many times, though, the ancient colosseums and European structures that are part of Turkish history made multiple appearances.Maria B.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s summer luxury lawn particularly brought on the Turkish touch by featuring Ayeza Khan as well as Gulsim Ali, who acted in the popular Turkish sered extensively and, judging from the response on the brandÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s e-store, the suits have sold quite well.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½TurkeyÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s a great location generally because it is so picturesque and there are so many production facilities available,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ says Maria.

I dont think that net and organza dupattas are comfortable in the summer, so instead the collection features beautiful silk and voile dupattas.elan elan, also, has a sister brand, zaha, which dabbles with less pricey, slightly less elaborate lawn. this constitutes as day-wear. similarly, designer zainab chottani has diversified this year to bring out two lawn collections the pricier titched suits, from the high-priced festive designs to more basic lawns for daily-wear.The copycat culturehowever, even more affordable lawn brands cannot beat the pricing that is the result of the lawn plagiarism trade running rampant in local marketplaces. small kiosks in popular markets, such as lahores liberty and aashiana in karachi, are stacked high with designer lawn replicas at a fraction of the originals price. from the chiffon dupatta to the embroidered border, every design detail may get replicated into an inferior version. even the packaging may seem the same, boxes and plastic bags proudly declaring the original brand name!back in 2015, when designer faraz manan would bring out seasonal lawn collections, some of his designs were somehow leaked prior to their official release. counterfeits were created with great efficiency and were released into the market on the same day as the original laways end up buying it. nevertheless, seeing a substandard copy at a mall of your brand new lawn suit must diminish some of the excitement of wearing the design.given that lawn designers have now become savvier, offering regular sales in order to draw the customer away from copycats, does plagiarism still hurt luxury lawn sales?sana safinaz asim jofa, one of the most copied brands in the market, observes, I dont think that it hurts as much as it used to. in my 11 years experience of creating designer lawn, I have noticed that customers that buy the original will always choose to do so. over time, I have also seen a greater diversification between people who buy the original and those who opt for copies. they are unlikely to be moving in the same social circles so, usually, my customer wont be bothered by the copies at all.also, its important to keep mo be marketing a new collection. ive even seen entire collections in the market that are not copies of my designs, but boldly have my brand logo printed on them! laughs Asim.A common story whispered in lahore is of a very popular lawn brand that got tired of copycats and decided to surreptitiously produce a copycat substandard brand of their own, catering to a lower economic bracket. quite ingenious!TurkistanThe marketing of lawn has also always been a case study all on its own. before relations soured with india, bollywood actresses were often enlisted to model collections faraz manans campaigns with kareena kapoor come to mind. once india was ruled out, the focus quickly zeroed in on local actresses who continue to be the faces for collections sometimes to the point of ubiquity.ayeza khan, for instance, is possibly the face of more than five lawn collections this year. the part from the celebrity circus, brands have also often opted to shoot their collections in exotic foreign locations. before the coronavirus pandemic came along, this meant that a lawn catalogue could be a veritable travelogue, traversing the nooks of european towns, cosmopolitan cities and tropical isles. this year, though, it meant that many of pakistans lawn moguls had the same bright idea of shooting in turkey, one of the few countries open for travel during the pandemic.from zainab chottani to elan, maria B. and a host of lesser known brands, turkey was the location du jour. some of the shoots were artistically done, sweeping over scenery in lesser known parts of the country. many times, though, the ancient colosseums and european structures that are part of turkish history made multiple appearances.maria b.s summer luxury lawn particularly brought on the turkish touch by featuring ayeza khan as well as gulsim ali, who acted in the popular turkish sered extensively and, judging from the response on the brands e-store, the suits have sold quite well.turkeys a great location generally because it is so picturesque and there are so many production facilities available, says maria. I think that the marketing campaign worked very well too but, ultimately, if the final product hadnt been good, then customers couldnt have been tricked into buying it.amongst other marketing ploys that have stood out, sana safinaz made their lawn look uber-glamorous by creating an entire fashion film showcasing the new collection. asim jofa introduced his lawn collection with a song sung by farhan saeed and featuring the singer and actress hania aamir. fahad hussayns lawn fashion film starred actress noor zafar khan and told the story of a youny added-on frills and fripperies, its now occasion-wear for women all across Pakistan.It may often get stuck in a repetitive over-the-top rut, the pricing may sky-rocket and a lot of times you may find it difficult to ascertain how it can be considered fashion-forward, but based on the continued hype, it is what pakistanis want to wear to all those parties that theyre going to despite the c"
Agriculture sector: challenges and way forward,2021-03-29,Tribune,"Farmers cannot switch to new technologies as they require heavy investment
KARACHI:
 
 Agriculture is one of the key sectors of  Pakistan ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economy. It comprises crops, livestock, forestry and fishing with crops being the major component. 
 This sector not only produces 19.3% of total output of the country but also provides employment to around 38.7% of the population, higher than all other sectors. This sector supports other related industries such as textile, sugar, tractor manufacturing, fertiliser, etc through strong forward and backward linkages. 
 A high yield in the  agriculture sector  also fosters commerce and trade since most of the farmers fall in the low or lower middle-income group whose marginal propensity to consume is high. Therefore, the contribution of this sector goes beyond what is reflected by statistics. Unfortunately, the sector, like many others, is performing well below its potential. Among major crops, the production of cotton is declining continuously over the last few years. 
 Last year, Pakistan produced around 9.18 million bales of cotton whereas in 2014-15, its production was 13.96 million bales. 
 Last year, the output of wheat and sugarcane was also insufficient to meet the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s needs. Owing to this, the government had to import both sugar and wheat, which placed an additional burden on the national exchequer. 
 If we look at productivity, PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s per acre yield of  major crops  is less than that of other countries in the region. Unfortunately, this gap is widening further. There is an urgent need to study the factors and put in all efforts to revive the sector. 
 There is a long list of problems that need to be addressed. However, this piece will cover only some of those and the rest will be discussed sometime later. 
 Research centres 
 First, there is a need to restructure the agricultural research institutes. In line with the best global practices, the pay and incentive structure must be revised and linked with the output on the ground. 
 If we link the research institutes with industries and develop a revenue-sharing mechanism, such that part of revenue from a newly developed or improved product goes to the institution and the researcher also gets a fixed percentage, then this will not only incentivise the development of quality seeds, better pesticides and good farm techniques, but will also help increase the budget of such institutes. 
 Departments of agriculture at provincial levels are not playing their role actively. In fact, their performance has deteriorated over time. In the past, the Punjab agriculture department used to lease small pieces of land in various villages to cultivate crops with the help of local farmers by applying new techniques and latest research. 
 Field officers and other staff of the department used to visit and examine the land with the farmers and briefed them about their experiences. Such arrangements acted as field schools for the farmers, who could learn and update their farming skills by listening to the experts and observing the outcome of newly applied techniques. 
 However, now for more than a decade, not such activity has been noted anywhere. Instead, the agriculture department arranges seminars in expensive hotels in cities, thus limiting the access of small farmers to such sessions. 
 Apart from that, these seminars are arranged with the support of pesticide, fertiliser or seed companies. This gives birth to serious conflict of interest and the recommendations given through such platforms are not trusted. 
 The absence of guidelines from independent sources has left farmers at the mercy of sales agents of the pesticide, fertiliser and seed firms. Students of economics know that firms aim to maximise profit by selling maximum quantity and at the highest possible price, but this leads to an increase in the cost of agriculture production. 
 Therefore, there is a need to think of the role of agriculture departments in the provinces. 
 Water scarcity 
 Water shortage is another issue that is affecting agricultural output. Pakistan has not built any major dam for decades, therefore, the scarcity of water is affecting every sector and its consequences can be more severe in future. 
 Experts call for adopting modern irrigation systems such as drip irrigation and sprinkle irrigation, as embraced by various countries. The government, with the help of global financial institutions, is working to facilitate the adoption of such technologies, but all suggestions and actions ignore the fact that in Pakistan a majority of the farmers hold small-sized farms (of less than 12.5 acres). 
 These farmers cannot afford to switch to these technologies as they require heavy investment, even after subsidies are provided. Unfortunately, these farmers also have limited access to financial support from banks for various reasons. 
 Therefore, there is a need to provide solutions that can remove the constraints. Unfortunately, not a single solution has been proposed by any publicly funded research institute or department. 
 Fortunately, Pedavar, an NGO led by a renowned agricultural expert and run by farmers themselves, has come up with a cheap solution. They favour the cultivation of crops on raised beds and keeping the beds covered with residual of the previous crop. This slows down the evaporation process and keeps the beds wet for a long period, thus the farmers do not need to water the fields for a longer period. 
 As per Pedavar, it not only results in 70% reduction in water consumption, but the residual also keeps the fertility of soil high, thus fertiliser is not needed, which further slashes the cost. 
 Food crops cultivated as per the proposed system can be sold as organic food in the global market. This way, exports and foreign exchange earnings can be multiplied. 
 Agriculture departments and research centres can test the system. If it works, then they must educate the farmers at grassroots level. Setting up field schools for the purpose, as Punjab did in the past, will accelerate its adoption. 
 It needs to be pointed out that most of the graduates in the field of agriculture end up joining the sales teams of pesticide, fertiliser and seed companies. This is apparently the field of marketing graduates and a graduate in agriculture should ideally take farming as the profession as the knowledge he/she has gained will be utilised better. 
 The government can introduce an incentive programme which encourages the agricultural graduates to join farming as the profession. Incentives can include leasing public land to the graduates at concessionary rates, priority access to loans, etc.

I dont even want to imagine what it must be like for him.nadir, a tailor master, had to close down his shop at gizri as the rent of the place piled up. he had to auction his sewing machines to clear his liabilities. months of struggle for bare survival has weakened nadirs resolve to earn an honest living. he said he is unsure if he can turn down a work offer on moral grounds any longer. it would have been easier had we all contracted Covid-19 and died, he said in utter despair while talking to dawn in his tiny shack of a house in Qayumabad.With the help of the establishment, the government might be able to manage the oppctators in the past wouldnt leave, commented a political economist.the relevant ministers and secretaries were approached, but they did not respond to calls and messages.

National security lies in a vibrant economy,2021-03-29,Dawn,"Notwithstanding some fleeting moments of political triumphs and economic gains for the policymakers, the lack of strategic breakthrough over the past two years plus the political heat generated by multiple crises are together turning out to be a game-changer. And pieced together, the historical baggage inherited by the government is providing backup support for a radical change in national security policy. The situation, as it is developing, is prompting the government to redesign national security policy with economic progress as its core. It is broadly defined to include human security. Addressing Islamabad Security Dialogue on March 17, the advisor on commerce and investment Razak Dawood stressed that a strong economy will enhance the countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s power and strengthen national security. Mr Dawood recalled that history has shown that economic backwardness led to social conflicts and political turmoil and this weakened national security. The New Comprehensive Security Framework evolved and incumbent government is based on three pillars of military, economic and human security. The framework has redefined the frontiers of security to include climate security, food security and economic prosperity.Development experts recognise that the uneven growth of various sectors of the economy is a major cause of surging inequality in regional development and household incomesSimilarly, consultations for policymaking will be much more broad-based with an intake of diverse views and inputs.The recently set up National Security Division connects over 100 think-tanks and university departments with policymakers. These entities can send their recommendations directly to the Security Division. Mr Dawood reminded his audience that the loss of economic security led to the erosion of national sovereignty. It may be recalled that the decade of development of the 1960s created a strong public perception about gross disparity in regional development and household incomes and led to political turmoil, armed conflict, Indian intervention and the great tragedy of 1971. National sovereignty can only be strengthened by a policy of self-reliance with a strong focus on citizenÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s welfare.The industrial revolution ushered in the country by former President Mohammad Ayub Khan needed a corresponding updated political system to unite a deeply divided nation.The national unity was regained when the assembly members elected in free and fair 1970 elections unanimously adopted the 1973 Constitution. The citizen-based democracy is essential to rebuild a common interest state as opposed to divisive dysfunctional hybrid democracy. Mr Dawood also made another very pertinent point. He said a nation like Pakistan could not depend on import and trading and the country needed to focus on manufacturing based on technology. And he added that a strong industrial base has to be anchored to agriculture, energy, food and financial security. Development experts recognise that the uneven growth of various sectors of the ecf surging inequality in regional development and household incomes. Mr Dawood views are somewhat similar to President Biden foreign trade policy inherited from Donald Trump. Katherine Tai of the United States Trade Representative Office recently told the US Senate that she would protect the rights and interests of the American workers rather than exporters or consumers. That means supporting the domestic manufacturing sector. In his first major foreign policy speech on March 3, Secretary of State Antony J Blinken said the calculus on free trade has changed. The Biden Administration has put new trade deals on the back burner while focusing on the domestic economy. Globalisation is now in a transformational phase with enormous international flows of updated information and knowledge, embedded in new technologies, scientific discoveries and innovative ideas to bring about the needed change. International cooperation is now focused on health care as a result of the common threat from coronavirus. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½cs to redefine itself and progress towards the modernised economy from where it not seen from the microscope because of what is happening in Afghanistan,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ said former US Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter at the Islamabad Security Dialogue forum. He was giving his views on the future of US-Pakistan relations. Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa says we need to Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½put our house in orderÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½. There can be no two opinions about it. We need to develop a sound and effective long-term strategy to put the political economy on an even keel and lower the political temperature to create a conducive environment for the government and business to work in harmony to rebuild Pakistan. And as it appears, from now on to the end of his tenure, Prime Minister Imran Khan is likely to spend much of his time fighting a battle for survival like all his predecessors did. The crises-triggered political pressure is unlikely to ease as it is further fproach to dealing with political rivals. The new comprehensive security framework is a step in the right direction. But this requires a correction course where a number of official policies and decisions are working at cross purposes. How can the International Monetary FundÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s (IMF) tax-and energy-reforms that are proposed to be enforced through ordinances succeed without national consensus and ownership? This demonstrates that there is strong opposition within the government as well as from common citizens against IMF policies. There is a need to review the role of elected representatives and technocrats in policymaking. In a democracy, technocrats are needed to provide policy inputs and not formulate policies unacceptable to elected representatives and the parliament. It is encouraging that there is a general consensus in the top civil and military leadership that PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s best defence is as much the prosperity of its people as the integrity of its borderenant General Talat Masood. He emphasises that this demands a sustained, integrated and comprehensive approach towards security spanning decades.The quality of life of the common citizens can best be improved by allowing the people to exercise their sovereign right to rule through representatives elected in a free and fair election. Under representative democracy, the elected members of the National Assembly and Member of the provincial assemblies are duty-bound to implement the policies and programmes approved by the electorate. And they are accountable to voters/active citizenry and no one else. Otherwise, we are left with a lame-duck democracy and aggravating political and economic problems that erode national security.

Economy ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â˜resilientÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ in the time of Covid,2021-03-29,Tribune,"KARACHI:Experts have agreed that PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economy fared much better than many other emerging markets during the coronavirus pandemic which has caused the entire world economy to shrink.However, they believe that a clearer picture of the national economy will emerge later this year after Covid-19 vaccines are administered to the general public on a large scale.Taking part in a panel discussion titled ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœPost Pandemic Economy of PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â at the 12th Karachi Literature Festival (KLF) on Sunday, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Deputy Governor Murtaza Syed said many emerging markets witnessed 5-10% contraction in growth while Pakistan faced just 0.5% decline.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœAfter the pandemic hit Pakistan, our current account went from deficit to a surplus, foreign exchange reserves rose to $13 billion and the country improved significantly on the fiscal front,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœInflation remains high. However, it has retreated from the double digit numbers seen during the Covid shock.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂAccording to the SBP deputy governor, the economy has largely bounced back to the same level where it was in pre-Covid times. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe currencies of Egypt, Turkey, Brazil, South Africa depreciated by 30-40% in the past one year but Pakistani rupee remained largely stable,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he added.Keeping earlier global financial crunches in view, he said, whenever an external shock struck the world, PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economy plunged. However, this was not the case during Covid-19 pandemic.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœOur growth fell to zero during the global financial crisis of 2008. But this time the national economy remained resilient and Pakistan came out much better than other emerging markets,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said.Citing the reason behind this, he said when the virus hit Pakistan the country was in the process of tackling with the ballooning fiscal deficit and narrowing the current account deficit through institutional reforms which helped keep the economy strong amid the Covid crisis.Secondly, the immediate measures undertaken by the SBP, such as slashing the interest rate to 7% and financing wages and salaries of workers, helped the economy recover better than its global peers.Speaking at the panel discussion, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Institutional Reforms Dr Ishrat Husain said when Covid-19 broke out, the federal government and the SBP realised that they needed to make concerted efforts to reach out to poorer segments of the economy.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœOn the one hand, we needed strategies to help those who lost their jobs such as daily wage earners and hawkers while on the other hand, we required a roadmap to encourage businesses to run efficiently in order to keep the wheels of the economy turning,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said.He appreciated the SBP for introducing multiple facilities at subsidised rates to help the economy escape the crisis. Talking about the impact of the crisis on different sectors, Bank of Punjab President Zafar Masud said Covid affected the economy in many different ways.He said the technology sector expanded rapidly due to it but at the same time, travel and tourism were hit the worst. He pointed out that the real impact of the disease on the banking sector would be visible after a few months when the benefits of the SBP schemes would become visible.Masud speculated that the small and medium enterprises (SME) and agriculture sectors could emerge to be the worst hit areas in Pakistan once the country manages to eradicate the malady.State-owned enterprisesPakistan International Airlines (PIA) Chief Financial Officer Khalilullah Shaikh drew attention to worsening conditions of the public sector organisations.

It has invested at least $18.5 billion in WeWork since 2017, including $6 billion when a fundraising round valued the startup at $47 billion in January 2019.The sources described the meeting between Neumann and RanadiveÃŒÂ on condition of anonymity. Representatives for Neumann, WeWork, UBS and SoftBank declined to comment. RanadiveÃŒÂ did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Neumann, who has kept a low profile since his unceremonious ouster after WeWork's failed IPO attempt in 2019, has had a contentious relationship with SoftBank.The Japanese tech investment giant pushed for his ouster before it took over WeWork in a $10 billion rescue financing deal in October 2019. It later backtracked on an agreement to buy $3 billion of WeWork shares from Neumann and other investors, citing criminal and civil investigations into WeWork, the company's failure to restructure a joint venture in China, and the shift to remote work due to the COVID-19 outbreak.One week before the case was due to go to trial, SoftBank reached a settlement with Neumann and other investors in February to pay out about half of its original commitment.

BowX was the only SPAC that expressed a serious interest in WeWork, two of the sources said.RanadiveÃŒÂ, a 63-year-old technology executive turned investor and owner of the Sacramento Kings basketball team, said last week WeWork stood to benefit from a shift by many companies to a hybrid model of working that calls for employees to come in to a workplace just a few days a month.He called the shift a tailwind for WeWork.The deal was received well by Wall Street, with BowX shares ending trade on Friday up 20% following the merger's announcement.WeWork's valuation was revised down in the final stages of the negotiations. Investors participating in the private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction managed to drive down WeWork's valuation in the agreement from $9.9 billion to $9 billion, including debt, the sources said. The size of the PIPE increased to $800 million from $500 million.RanadiveÃŒÂ and the rest of the BowX senior team will receive WeWork shares worth almost $90 million after investing $11.7 million of their own money.

BowX was the only SPAC that expressed a serious interest in WeWork, two of the sources said.ranadive, a 63-year-old technology executive turned investor and owner of the sacramento kings basketball team, said last week WeWork stood to benefit from a shift by many companies to a hybrid model of working that calls for employees to come in to a workplace just a few days a month.he called the shift a tailwind for WeWork.The deal was received well by wall street, with BowX shares ending trade on friday up 20% following the merger announcement.WeWork valuation was revised down in the final stages of the negotiations. investors participating in the private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction managed to drive down WeWork valuation in the agreement from $9.9 billion to $9 billion, including debt, the sources said. the size of the PIPE increased to $800 million from $500 million.ranadive and the rest of the BowX senior team will receive WeWork shares worth almost $90 million after investing $11.7 million of their own money. they will be restricted from selling these shares for the first year unless certain share price targets are met."

Pakistan - low on emissions but hard-hit by climate change,2021-03-29,Tribune,"KARACHI:Pakistan has seen unprecedented flooding, glacial lake outbursts and several other climate-related disasters in the past decade.

As the session began, Khan, who is a frequent participant of the United Nations Climate Change Conference - the Conference of the Parties (COP), elaborated on PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s efforts towards countering the impacts of climate change at the global level.Pakistan sends a delegation led by the minister of climate change each year as its part of the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s foreign policy, she said.

Similarly, Spence pointed out that regular locust storms were destroying croplands in Sindh and Punjab. Moreover, floods, heat waves and melting glaciers were the most immediate signs of the climate crisis in the country, she said.The geographer predicted that these effects would only get worse over time and recommended that timely goals be set to limit harm.

Farmers hit by Ravi Riverfront Urban Project dig in heels,2021-03-29,Dawn,"THESE green fields and lychee orchards, divided by a dusty road, in a village along the Ravi near Sheikhupura will soon give way to a jungle of concrete. CHAUDHRY Sajjad Warraich was happy with the produce he was getting from his farmland and orchards, which lay about five kilometres from the Kala Khatai-Narang Mandi road, until a few weeks back when he learnt that his land had been included in the controversial Ravi Riverfront Urban Project, allegedly for the benefit of a handful of rich and powerful real estate developers.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½The PTI government forcibly included 500 acres of my family in the project.

Besides lychee, Warraich has got mango, lemon and guava orchards whose cost, according to him, is not being paid to him.At places his family has acquired farmland as far away as 5km from the river, which makes a curve near his land. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½In the name of taking only the riverbed for the project, the government has occupied our farmlands.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Warraich has pieces of land in Eyyah Nagar Kalan, Eyyah Nagar Khurd and Rakh Dhanoya villages, and the whole of the last village has been acquired by the government without giving any notice before acquiring land.The government has reportedly acquired ov acquired land in Bokanwala, Kherdinpur, Chohan, Kachi Kotli, Qadian, Rasoolpur, Dhanoya, Shediwal, Ratniwal, Babakwal, Nehraypur, Jada and Dandian villages by imposing Section 5 of the Land Acquisition Act 1894 of the colonial era.About 15 families live in Nehraypur, a small village whose all 63 acres have been acquired for the first phase of the project, which is eight to nine kilometres long, says Warraich. The total length of the project is 46km, all along the Ravi.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½They (officials) didnÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t even mention our houses and are offering us the price of land only,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ says Nishan Ali, a farmer from the Nehraypur village, all of whose residents are not from landowning families. Haji Nausher Ali, who Dawn met on the way, also lives there with his family and cultivates about 11 acres.Most villagers losing their land to the project are small holders. The maximum price of land has been fixed at Rs1.28 million per acre and it is Rs200,000 per acing paid,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ he says.Warraich has moved the court against acquisition of his land. He rues the loss of farmland, saying housing schemes should not be set up on agricultural land. He has grown chilli, beetroot and onion in the fields while his guava orchard has 10,000 trees spread over 37 acres. All these products feed the city of Lahore.Mian Mustafa Rasheed of the PML-F, who has led protests against the project in Lahore, says the government has cleverly taken greater part of land from Sheikhupura districtÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s villages and spared most of Lahore in the first phase.

CHAUDHRY sajjad warraich was happy with the produce he was getting from his farmland and orchards, which lay about five kilometres from the kala Khatai-Narang mandi road, until a few weeks back when he learnt that his land had been included in the controversial ravi riverfront urban project, allegedly for the benefit of a handful of rich and powerful real estate developers.the PTI government forcibly included 500 acres of my family in the project. it gave us no information until march 2, when officials told me they had acquired the land and gave me a notice that the government was bound to send me two weeks earlier, says warraich, who is in his 60s, while sitting in his lychee orchard in eyyah nagar kalan village in ferozewala tehsil of Sheikhupura.A tattered pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf flag flutters atop a supported in the 2018 elections is now snatching away his home and property from him to give to its mightier and wealthier business allies in the name of public good and development.warraichs outhouse is more than two kilometres from ravis riverbed that cant even be seen with naked eyes from his home. besides lychee, warraich has got mango, lemon and guava orchards whose cost, according to him, is not being paid to him.at places his family has acquired farmland as far away as 5km from the river, which makes a curve near his land. in the name of taking only the riverbed for the project, the government has occupied our farmlands.warraich has pieces of land in eyyah nagar kalan, eyyah nagar khurd and rakh dhanoya villages, and the whole of the last village has been acquired by the government without giving any notice before acquiring land.the government has reportedly acquired ov acquired land in bokanwala, kherdinpur, chohan, kachi kotli, qadian, rasoolpur, dhanoya, shediwal, ratniwal, babakwal, nehraypur, jada and dandian villages by imposing section 5 of the land acquisition act 1894 of the colonial era.about 15 families live in nehraypur, a

Ravi.They (officials) didnt even mention our houses and are offering us the price of land only, says nishan ali, a farmer from the nehraypur village, all of whose residents are not from landowning families. haji nausher ali, who dawn met on the way, also lives there with his family and cultivates about 11 acres.most villagers losing their land to the project are small holders. the maximum price of land has been fixed at rs 1.28 million per acre and it is rs 200,000 per acing paid, he says.warraich has moved the court against acquisition of his land. he rues the loss of farmland, saying housing schemes should not be set up on agricultural land. he has grown chilli, beetroot and onion in the fields while his guava orchard has 10,000 trees spread over 37 acres. all these products feed

Digital banks: still a distant dream,2021-03-29,Dawn,"While much of the country, particularly prime-time TV anchors and politicians, was hooked to the issue of the central bankÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s independence and its possible impact, another major development took shape last Friday: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) unveiled the Digital Bank Regulatory Framework draft. It lays out the regulations and procedures by which challenger banks will come into being and function.Over the past few years, we have seen a number of regulatory regimes introduced, with the aim of promoting digital financial services. So some people might get confused. LetÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s try to make that clear. First came the Payment Service Operator/Provider rules, which enabled routing, clearing and processing of electronic transactions and included entities like 1LINK. Then the Electronic Money Institutions (EMI) Regulations were brought in, eliminating fintech playersÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ dependence on banks for the distribution of e-money. However, their mandate ten for settlement. Currently, none of the entities with approval has commercially launched yet. With the latest policy draft, a proper full-stack digital bank capable of lending and investing is being envisioned.In fact, the draft document lays out a plan for EMIs to transition to a digital bank and requires at least one year of delivering digital financial services. Other possible sponsors can be existing local or international development finance institutions (DFIs)/microfinance banks (MFBs) with their eligibility criteria specified.Under the draft policy, a digital retail bank will be allowed to deal with retail customers while a digital full bank can offer services to corporate and commercial clients as well Under the draft policy, the SBP identifies two categories: digital retail bank (DRB) and digital full bank (DFB). As the name suggests, the former will be allowed to deal with retail customers while the latter can offer services across segments, including corporate, commercial and retail. Both, in turn, can either be conventional or Islamic.Similar to the previous SBP regulations with respect to fintechs, there is a phased process that begins with the submission of relevant documentation and a Rs4 million non-refundable deposit as processing fee, accompanied with a feasibility study and sponsorsÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ financial strength. A possibly interesting pointer here is that: Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½A reliance on undue subsidies or financial incentives from the group that creates an unsustainable quicker path to profitability shall be discouraged.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ Appreciation for sound unit economics aside, challenger banks around the world arenÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t exactly known for this. Their modus operandi revolves around raising huge rounds and burning cash aggressively in order to carve a market share for themselves. Moving on, once a Fit and Proper Test is done and a no-objection certificate given for the incorporation of a public limited company with the Securities P. After that come the pilot operations stipulated for at least a three-month period. Once all of these stages are done and the regulator satisfied, the applicant may finally go for a commercial launch.The proposed policy also lays out the structure and competencies of the board, which should have seven members, including at least one woman, have experience in providing DFS and knowledge of emerging technologies among other things.  As for the minimum capital requirements, the draft suggests a floor that progresses as an entity moves from licensing to commercial launch as well as the subsequent three years. For a DRB, at least Rs1.5 billion is needed at the first stage. It increases to Rs2bn at the time of commercial rollout, Rs2.5bn a year after that, Rs3bn in the second year and Rs4bn in third Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ a period defined as the transition phase during which the sponsors will be barred to dispose of their shares.On the other hand, a DFB needs to have at least Rs6.5bn for the pilot/licensing r commercial launch and Rs10bn in the second year Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ having a two-year progression phase instead of three. At the conclusion of that period, they are required to be listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange unless a subsidy of a traditional bank. Similarly, there are capital adequacy as well as advances-to-deposits requirements specified for each type.It remains to be seen how big of a challenge meeting these funding needs will be, considering the ticket size of investments into local fintechs.

Till then, enjoy going to the eekly, March 29th, 2021","digital banks still a distant dream while much of the country, particularly prime-time TV anchors and politicians, was hooked to the issue of the central banks independence and its possible impact, another major development took shape last friday the state bank of pakistan (SBP) unveiled the digital bank regulatory framework draft. it lays out the regulations and procedures by which challenger banks will come into being and function.over the past few years, we have seen a number of regulatory regimes introduced, with the aim of promoting digital financial services. so some people might get confused. lets try to make that clear. first came the payment service Operator/Provider rules, which enabled routing, clearing and processing of electronic transactions and included entities like 1LINK. then the electronic money institutions (EMI) regulations were brought in, eliminating fintech players dependence on banks for the distribution of e-money. however, their mandate ten for settlement. currently, none of the entities with approval has commercially launched yet. with the latest policy draft, a proper full-stack digital bank capable of lending and investing is being envisioned.in fact, the draft document lays out a plan for EMIs to transition to a digital bank and requires at least one year of delivering digital financial services. other possible sponsors can be existing local or international development finance institutions (DFIs)/microfinance banks (MFBs) with their eligibility criteria specified.under the draft policy, a digital retail bank will be allowed to deal with retail customers while a digital full bank can offer services to corporate and commercial clients as well under the draft policy, the SBP identifies two categories digital retail bank (DRB) and digital full bank (DFB). as the name suggests, the former will be allowed to deal with retail customers while the latter can offer services across segments, including corporate, commercial and retail. both, in turn, can either be conventional or Islamic.Similar to the previous SBP regulations with respect to fintechs, there is a phased process that begins with the submission of relevant documentation and a rs 4 million non-refundable deposit as processing fee, accompanied with a feasibility study and sponsors financial strength. A possibly interesting pointer here is that A reliance on undue subsidies or financial incentives from the group that creates an unsustainable quicker path to profitability shall be discouraged. appreciation for sound unit economics aside, challenger banks around the world arent exactly known for this. their modus operandi revolves around raising huge rounds and burning cash aggressively in order to carve a market share for themselves. moving on, once a fit and proper test is done and a no-objection certificate given for the incorporation of a public limited company with the securities P. after that come the pilot operations stipulated for at least a three-month period. once all of these stages are done and the regulator satisfied, the applicant may finally go for a commercial launch.the proposed policy also lays out the structure and competencies of the board, which should have seven members, including at least one woman, have experience in providing DFS and knowledge of emerging technologies among other things. as for the minimum capital requirements, the draft suggests a floor that progresses as an entity moves from licensing to commercial launch as well as the subsequent three years. for a DRB, at least rs 1.5 billion is needed at the first stage. it increases to rs 2bn at the time of commercial rollout, rs 2.5bn a year after that, rs 3bn in the second year and rs 4bn in third a period defined as the transition phase during which the sponsors will be barred to dispose of their shares.on the other hand, a DFB needs to have at least rs 6.5bn for the pilot/licensing r commercial launch and rs 10bn in the second year having a two-year progression phase instead of three. at the conclusion of that period, they are required to be listed on the pakistan stock exchange unless a subsidy of a traditional bank. similarly, there are capital adequacy as well as advances-to-deposits requirements specified for each type.it remains to be seen how big of a challenge meeting these funding needs will be, considering the ticket size of investments into local fintechs. the biggest round raised by anyone in the sector is finjas $9 million, which translates into rs 1.44bn even at a rs 160 exchange rate. obviously, startups are progressively raising more capital at every stage now and that trend is only growing. but remember, these are the minimum requirements. for the smooth functioning of the entity and its growth which should be based on lending instead of investing in risk-free assets rements are high or not, as its a full-stack digital bank with customers deposits involved. so erring on the higher side is always wiser.banks on the other hand should theoretically have little trouble in arranging these sums. but again, if they were really interested in lending, they could have done it decades ago. expecting them to change their rent-seeking modus operandi of feeding off government securities to actually making some effort and lending to customers without a recorded risk profile is like living in a fools paradise. existing DFIs might still go for the approval and use any opportunity at every conference about being a tech company with a banking licence. my heart sinks at this thought.all said and done, it will take a few years for us to see any impact of this regulation which, by the way, took two years to get to the current draft stage and might drag on here for god knows how long. till then, enjoy going to the eekly, march 29th, 2021"
