6,"KARACHI:The Pakistan Stock Exchange on Monday came under intense selling pressure as the surging coronavirus cases rattled investors and pushed the benchmark index deep into the red with a drop of over 1,000 points.The rising tally of Covid-19 infections across the country, particularly in Punjab, raised alarm in major sectors of the economy as well as the stock market. The government of Punjab on Monday announced smart lockdowns across various districts where the Covid-19 positivity ratio was 12% or higher.The benchmark KSE-100 index seesawed as investors struggled to anticipate the impact of stringent measures being taken by the government in the wake of resumption of International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme.The KSE-100 index started diving from the moment trading began and nosedived over 1,000 points to below 45,000 points. However, some buying activity at regular intervals helped the index recover the lost ground a little bit.It still finished trading deep in the red as weak investor sentiment restricted it from entering the positive territory.At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 1,089.83 points, or 2.39%, to settle at 44,431.8 points.Alpha Beta Core CEO Khurram Schehzad said that the marketÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s drop reflected investor concern over the worsening Covid-19 crisis in Pakistan.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœIn the past few days, Punjab has been worst hit by the pandemic and market participants are now expecting a lockdown in the province,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœSince Punjab contributes significantly to the economy, a lockdown will not bode well for the market and Pakistan as a whole.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂEndorsing his views, AA Gold Commodities Director Operations Adnan Agar said that skyrocketing Covid infections and looming fear of lockdown in Punjab dented investor sentiment at the bourse.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœAnother factor fuelling the decline is the presidential ordinance, which will end tax exemptions for major sectors of the economy,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœSuch a move is not in favour of the market, hence a fall is being witnessed.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂJS Global analyst Maaz Mulla said a carnage was witnessed as the KSE-100 index lost 1,090 points. It closed the session at 44,432, down 2.4%. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThis pressure in the market was partially due to the increasing Covid-19 cases in the country,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he said.Positivity rates were already in double digits and well beyond those seen during the second wave while the absolute number of infections also dwarfed the second-wave levels.Moreover, in later hours of trading, mutual funds redemption also dented investor sentiment.Volumes stood at 524 million shares, where top contributors were Byco Petroleum (-7.9%), Pakistan Refinery (-7.3%), Azgard Nine (-0.1%), TRG Pakistan (-7.3%), Pakistan Telecommunication Company (-5.6%) and Unity Foods (-7.1%).Selling pressure was witnessed in the refinery and technology sectors where Attock Refinery (-6.9%), National Refinery (-6.9%), Pakistan Refinery (-7.3%), Byco Petroleum (-7.9%), NetSol (-7.5%), TRG Pakistan (-7.3%) and Avanceon (-7.2%) closed at their respective lower locks.The cement sector followed the same trend where Pioneer Cement (-5.8%), Cherat Cement (-5.3%), Maple Leaf Cement Factory (-3.7%), DG Khan Cement (-3.8%) and Lucky Cement (-2.3%) shed value.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœGoing forward, we expect the market to remain bearish on the back of uncertainty amid the coronavirus pandemic and recommend investors to remain cautious,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â the analyst said.Overall trading volumes dropped to 523.9 million shares compared with FridayÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s tally of 529.2 million.

7,"ISLAMABAD: Referring to an apparent collapse of the multiparty opposition alliance, Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said on Monday that both the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had parted ways under the banner of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) due to conflict of interests. Addressing a news conference after inaugurating the Quaid-e-AzamÃ¢Â€Â™s rehabilitated portrait at Islamabad Expressway, which was collapsed due to overnight rain last year, he said both the parties had remained arch political rivals in the past but made the alliance under the PDM's banner only to oust Prime Minister Imran Khan.  He claimed that their political moves posed no threat to the government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, which had already completed its three years successfully.The minister said the government had nothing to do with the infighting of the PDMÃ¢Â€Â™s component parties, rather it happened due to their own incompetency. ""It led to the visible cracks deep inside the opposition alliance.""    He urged the opposition parties to support the government in the Parliament for major reforms including political, legal, electoral, and municipal reforms for the development of the country.Rashid regarded Prime Minister Imran Khan as Ã¢Â€Â˜the skipper of politicsÃ¢Â€Â™ and expressed his resolve for supporting him through all the thick and thins.The minister said the prime focus of the government was to address the basic issues of the masses such as inflation, adding, Ã¢Â€ÂœImran Khan sticks to his stance against corruption as the people of the country wanted full recovery of the looted money.""  He said it was the first time in the history of Pakistan that a ruling government would be issuing 100,000 National Identity Card (NIC) across the country. The mobile vans of the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) would reach each district of the country for registration of the citizens' CNICs, he added. He vowed to transform Islamabad into a Ã¢Â€Â˜city of parks and gardensÃ¢Â€Â™ by rooting out the land mafia in the federal capital. The glory of federal capital would be restored during the tenure of the Pakistan Tahreek-e Insaf government, the minister maintained.At present, he said some five big and 231 small parks were existed in the capital city, adding each of them would be renovated after 15 days of interval. He said a multipurpose sports park would be built around the Quaid's portrait, which was re-erected on a hillock along the Express Highway near Koral Interchange, after its fencing. The site would be developed within a short span of time to provide recreational opportunities to the passerby, he added.","[""A multipurpose sports park would be built around the Quaid's portrait, which was re-erected on a hillock along the Express Highway near Koral Interchange, after its fencing""]",0
8,"SHANGHAI: Wanda Group's revamped property management business has secured 3 billion yuan ($457.34 million) of strategic investment from the government of Zhuhai, a city in southern China, ahead of its planned listing, the Chinese developer said on Monday.Wanda Light Asset Commercial Management Co, which is tasked with managing 368 existing Wanda Plazas and a further 155 under construction, will seek to make strategic investment and acquisitions with the Zhuhai government following its planned listing, Wanda said in a statement on its website.Last week, Dalian Wanda Commercial Management, the parent of Wanda Light Asset, withdrew an application for a listing in China, saying it would restructure its assets and consider an overseas listing.The company aims to list in Hong Kong, according to local media reports and a source with knowledge of the plans.","['Wanda Light Asset Commercial Management Co, which is tasked with managing 368 existing Wanda Plazas and a further 155 under construction']",-1
9,"An unlikely figure helped set the spark for SoftBank Group Corp's $9 billion deal to take WeWork public.Adam Neumann, WeWork's co-founder and ousted chief executive, met in November with the head of the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) that would go on to clinch a deal with WeWork, according to people familiar with the matter.Neumann was locked in a fierce legal battle at the time with SoftBank over a $3 billion deal for a portion of his and other investors' stake in the office space-sharing company.The introduction between Neumann and BowX Acquisition Corp co-chief executive Vivek RanadiveÃŒÂ over a Zoom call was facilitated by a senior UBS Group AG capital markets banker, the sources said. It preceded discussions the SPAC chief had with WeWork.Neumann played up WeWork's prospects on the call and the conversation piqued RanadiveÃŒÂ's interest, the sources said.RanadiveÃŒÂ's SPAC had been looking for an acquisition target after raising $420 million in an IPO in August.The ensuing deal announced on Friday cushions some of the blow SoftBank has suffered with its investment in WeWork. It has invested at least $18.5 billion in WeWork since 2017, including $6 billion when a fundraising round valued the startup at $47 billion in January 2019.The sources described the meeting between Neumann and RanadiveÃŒÂ on condition of anonymity. Representatives for Neumann, WeWork, UBS and SoftBank declined to comment. RanadiveÃŒÂ did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Neumann, who has kept a low profile since his unceremonious ouster after WeWork's failed IPO attempt in 2019, has had a contentious relationship with SoftBank.The Japanese tech investment giant pushed for his ouster before it took over WeWork in a $10 billion rescue financing deal in October 2019. It later backtracked on an agreement to buy $3 billion of WeWork shares from Neumann and other investors, citing criminal and civil investigations into WeWork, the company's failure to restructure a joint venture in China, and the shift to remote work due to the COVID-19 outbreak.One week before the case was due to go to trial, SoftBank reached a settlement with Neumann and other investors in February to pay out about half of its original commitment. It did not want the potential legal liability to jeopardize the SPAC deal, the sources said.Neumann also stands to benefit from the SPAC deal as he still has a roughly 10% stake in WeWork, worth around $790 million.LIMITED OPTIONSNeumann had no role in the SPAC deal after his discussion with RanadiveÃŒÂ, the sources said. RanadiveÃŒÂ and his team began discussions with WeWork in December. SoftBank Chief Operating Officer and WeWork Executive Chairman Marcelo Claure led the negotiations on behalf of SoftBank, with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son also stepping in, one of the sources said.WeWork was apprehensive about opting for a traditional IPO following its failed attempt in 2019, and its options for a SPAC deal were limited. BowX was the only SPAC that expressed a serious interest in WeWork, two of the sources said.RanadiveÃŒÂ, a 63-year-old technology executive turned investor and owner of the Sacramento Kings basketball team, said last week WeWork stood to benefit from a shift by many companies to a hybrid model of working that calls for employees to come in to a workplace just a few days a month.He called the shift a tailwind for WeWork.The deal was received well by Wall Street, with BowX shares ending trade on Friday up 20% following the merger's announcement.WeWork's valuation was revised down in the final stages of the negotiations. Investors participating in the private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction managed to drive down WeWork's valuation in the agreement from $9.9 billion to $9 billion, including debt, the sources said. The size of the PIPE increased to $800 million from $500 million.RanadiveÃŒÂ and the rest of the BowX senior team will receive WeWork shares worth almost $90 million after investing $11.7 million of their own money. They will be restricted from selling these shares for the first year unless certain share price targets are met.","[""The deal was received well by Wall Street, with BowX shares ending trade on Friday up 20% following the merger's announcement""]",0
10,"British shares reversed early gains on Monday, weighed down by banks and miners, although further easing of lockdown measures in England paved the way for a pickup in economic activity.The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.4%, with bank stocks including HSBC Holdings, Barclays and Prudential Financial Inc falling between 0.9% and 1.7%.Mining stocks including Rio Tinto, Anglo American , Glencore and BHP were also among the laggards.""We had Credit Suisse saying this morning 'we are going to suffer losses' and it's potentially a matter of time until more companies come out and say the same,"" said Connor Campbell, an analyst at Spreadex.""I think there is a certain air of restlessness around the markets this morning because the situation with Archegos Capital is unclear and that's feeding into the negative sentiment.""Nomura and Credit Suisse both flagged significant losses following transactions with an unnamed US client, although both announcements came after Archegos Capital Management roiled financial markets on Friday with a number of significant block trades.A raft of global stimulus has helped the FTSE 100 recover more than 37% from a coronavirus-driven crash last year, but a recent rise in COVID-19 cases across Europe has dampened investor sentiment.Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Britons to be cautious as a stay-at-home order and some other lockdown measures ended, citing rising cases in other parts of Europe and the threat posed by new variants of the virus.The domestically focused mid-cap FTSE 250 index slipped 0.1%, dragged down by industrials stocks.Online car seller Cazoo Holdings Ltd said it had agreed to go public in New York through a merger with AJAX I Acquisition Corp, a blank-check acquisition company led by billionaire US investor Dan Och.Food delivery company Deliveroo has seen investor demand for its initial public offering exceed the full deal size, setting the stage for London's biggest IPO in a decade.","['The blue-chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.4%, with bank stocks including HSBC Holdings, Barclays, and Prudential Financial Inc falling between 0.9% and 1.7%']",0
11,"KARACHI:Pakistan has seen unprecedented flooding, glacial lake outbursts and several other climate-related disasters in the past decade. The country ranks 135th in terms of global emissions but is counted among the countries most susceptible to climate change.These views were expressed by panellists at a session, at the 12th Karachi Literature Festival, titled, ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â˜The Air We Breathe: PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Vulnerability to Climate ChangeÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™.Read: ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â˜Country needs to up the ante in its diplomatic gameÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™The panellists, award-winning journalist, Rina Saeed Khan, and a geographer focused on water and climate politics, Tabitha Spence, noted that though the current government is inclined towards mitigating the effects of climate change, a major reason that work lags in this sector is that officials of the Ministry of Climate Change are frequently transferred from one project to another. As the session began, Khan, who is a frequent participant of the United Nations Climate Change Conference - the Conference of the Parties (COP), elaborated on PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s efforts towards countering the impacts of climate change at the global level.Pakistan sends a delegation led by the minister of climate change each year as its part of the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s foreign policy, she said. However, members of the delegation are frequently transferred to work on other projects, noted Khan. She believes that the ministry should have more trained and focused individuals and a stronger delegation to represent Pakistan at the international forum.It is also a part of the Group of 77 (G77) developing countries at the United Nations but it only follows the other countries when it comes to climate change negotiations, said Khan. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœ[The country] is not a big influencer [when it comes to] climate change but it is surely influenced by it.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂShe observed that though the country ranked 135th with regards to its global emissions its vulnerability to the effects of environmental degradation was much higher.Prone to climatic disasterThe country has seen frequent glacial lake outbursts, floods and other climate-related disasters since 2010, she said. These climatic disasters leave devastation in their wake in villages up in mountainous areas, and on those living in the vicinity of the Indus Delta, which is impacted by the rise in sea level.Bringing members of the communities most exposed to the impacts of climate change in Pakistan to the COPs would help bring the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s climate concerns to the forefront, according to her. Similarly, Spence pointed out that regular locust storms were destroying croplands in Sindh and Punjab. Moreover, floods, heat waves and melting glaciers were the most immediate signs of the climate crisis in the country, she said.The geographer predicted that these effects would only get worse over time and recommended that timely goals be set to limit harm. These goals should enable our communities to safeguard their resources and commodities, she stressed.Also read: A joke a day can keep KarachiÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s trauma at bayA pressing matterAs the discussion progressed, Khan observed that climate change is covered widely in the media. The younger journalists have seen what happens to farmers and are aware of the scale of its devastation globally and its effects in Pakistan, she remarked.While appreciating the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s inclinations towards dealing with climate change, she dubbed the 10 billion tree project and the premierÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s announcement to generate 60 per cent of the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s energy from renewable resources by 2030 as ambitious. Meanwhile, Spence drew attention towards the fact that global emissions have continued to rise and surpassed their pre-pandemic levels despite lockdowns across the globe. This proves that our policies never did change, she opined.Khan and Spence were joined by the United States acting Consul-General in Karachi, Jack Hillmeyer while Amy Christianson, the public affairs officer at the US consulate in Karachi moderated the session.

12,"THESE green fields and lychee orchards, divided by a dusty road, in a village along the Ravi near Sheikhupura will soon give way to a jungle of concrete. CHAUDHRY Sajjad Warraich was happy with the produce he was getting from his farmland and orchards, which lay about five kilometres from the Kala Khatai-Narang Mandi road, until a few weeks back when he learnt that his land had been included in the controversial Ravi Riverfront Urban Project, allegedly for the benefit of a handful of rich and powerful real estate developers.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½The PTI government forcibly included 500 acres of my family in the project.

Haji Nausher Ali, who Dawn met on the way, also lives there with his family and cultivates about 11 acres.Most villagers losing their land to the project are small holders.

25,"The federal cabinet early this week approved the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)  Ã¢Â€Â˜Amendment Bill 2021Ã¢Â€Â™. Reportedly, the bill advocates fundamental changes in the SBP founding laws of 1956. According to finance minister Dr Hafeez Sheikh, the SBPÃ¢Â€Â™s sole mandate would be Ã¢Â€Âœprice control and to independently set monetary policy and exchange rate policy.Ã¢Â€ÂThe amendments include administrative changes such as the term of office of the SBP governor shall be five years, the government shall not borrow or seek guarantees from the SBP for its operations, and the remuneration, terms and conditions of the service of the governor and deputy governors will be determined by the SBP board. The governor shall submit bankÃ¢Â€Â™s annual report before the parliament regarding the achievement of its objectives, conduct of monetary policy, state of the economy and overall functioning of financial system. The parliament may require any senior official to attend at such additional times as may be required.Ã¢Â€Â The proposed amendments seek protection to actions taken in good faith by providing indemnity, Ã¢Â€ÂœNo suit, prosecution or any other legal proceedings including for damages shall lie against the bank, its board of directors or members, governor, deputy governors and support for economic policies of the government has been declared as the Ã¢Â€Âœtertiary objectiveÃ¢Â€Â of the SBP. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cannot investigate the SBP governor, deputy governors, its executives and board and committee members including its former officials without permission of its board of directors. Whereas, on the legislation side, the federal government cannot make legislation without consulting the SBP. Ã¢Â€ÂœThe bank shall be consulted ex ante on any proposed legislative act related to the Bank,Ã¢Â€Â states Section 46B sub-section 8 of the ordinance. The definition of Ã¢Â€Âœmonetary liabilitiesÃ¢Â€Â has been introduced, which means total liabilities of the bank as reduced by the sum of Ã¢Â€Âœdeposits of the government, amounts owing to the IMF, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) or other such instruments, deposits of foreign central banks or sovereign wealth funds, utilised swap lines of foreign central banks and balance of participant central banks under any clearing unionÃ¢Â€Â.The proposed amendment bill has invited an outcry from the leading economists and analysts of the country - with wide coverage in the print, social and electronic media of the country. In the event of passage of this bill as is, the SBP governor perceived by some as an IMF insider, is being portrayed as an Ã¢Â€Â˜Economic ViceroyÃ¢Â€Â™ and the IMF as the East India Company out to usurp the sovereignty of the nation.Dramatic reforms in a country are difficult to be absorbed. Some oppose them out of vested interests and some out of emotions and lack of any rational approach, with some on merit. Setting aside for a while the apprehensions and opinions of the economists of the country, one is tempted to ponder on some basic and undeniable facts to draw out a logical conclusion based on some analytical and rational understanding.The IMF is a lending bank and like all lenders it lends money and ensures that the borrower has sufficient means and fiscal discipline to repay it. To ensure that, it would go to any lengths. In the 1990s, in the face of a severe economic crisis, India approached the IMF for a bailout. IndiaÃ¢Â€Â™s fiscal situation was so bad that the IMF refused to accept IndiaÃ¢Â€Â™s sovereign guarantees and instead demanded India deposited its bullion reserves as hard collateral. The then finance minister of India, Yashwant Sinha, ensured that tons of bullion was flown out from the vaults of Delhi treasury to the IMF vaults in London. Such is the extent to which IMF can go with its member clients. It is also a fact that sectoral regulators in Pakistan, by design, have been rendered ineffective and compromised. So much so that the former government stripped regulators Nepra and Ogra of their independent status and placed them under the line Ministry of Power and Oil & Gas, respectively. Whereas, countryÃ¢Â€Â™s prime regulatory bodies, including SBPÃ¢Â€Â™s, have largely been headed by the hand-picked political appointees.The clause to insulate SBP Governor, its principal officers and the board members from intervention of NAB and FIA is understandable. This Ã¢Â€Â˜precautionÃ¢Â€Â™ stems from an ongoing NAB investigation against SBP officers in the alleged non-transparent merger of the KASB and BankIslami. SBP executives fear that more of their actions would be challenged by NAB and FIA. But, similar has also been the demand of the bureaucracy and elite businessmen of the country as they want to conduct their responsibilities free from fear and perceived or real harassment by NAB. In case of SBP this condition may sail through under the guise of IMF flag, although it is unlikely that the Fund would put up this condition and meddle in the criminal law of the land. Their concern is limited to the independence of SBP and other regulatory entities of Pakistan. The clause pertaining to absolute autonomy to the board of SBP to conduct its business is similar to the recently rolled out reforms for the management of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) where the entity boards have been delegated the principal responsibility to its business free from political and bureaucratic interventions. Be that as it may, the country has to just settle the IMF loan and walk out to freedom. Unless we do that, the IMF and its dictates are here to stay.

26,"KARACHI:The Pakistani currency has maintained uptrend against the US dollar, as it hit a new over one-year high at Rs154.58 to the US dollar in the inter-bank market on Friday as supplies of the foreign currency remain high in the market compared to its demand.The rupee has made a notable fresh gain on the day the World Bank approved $1.3 billion for Pakistan, including $600 million for Ehsaas programme and to reduce poverty in the country.Besides, the country geared up to raise up to $1 billion from international market through launch of the Eurobond.The rupee closed at Rs155.01 to the greenback on Thursday, according to PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s central bank.With a fresh gain of Rs0.43 on Friday, the rupee has recovered 8.22% or Rs13.85 in the past seven-month to date since it hit all-time low of Rs168.43 on August 26, 2020.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe rupee has maintained uptrend mainly on reports Pakistan has resumed International Monetary FundÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s (IMF) loan programme worth $6 billion the other day,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â said Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) Chairman Malik Bostan while talking to The Express Tribune.He said that revival of the IMF programme after remaining on hold for about a year since the Covid-19 outbreak in Pakistan in February 2020 has revived the confidence level of local and global business community in the domestic economy. Accordingly, the development helped rupee strengthen further.The revival of IMF programme would also result in increase in supplies of the foreign currency, as the lending institution has approved release of third tranche worth $500 million to Pakistan soon.He said the foreign currency supplies may remain high going forward since the World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) both have announced to give $10-12 billion each over the next five years.The rupee has maintained uptrend partly on the report that PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s foreign currency reserves further increased by $275 million last week to $13.29 billion.The reserves may continue to grow with increasing inflows under the State Bank of PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s (SBP) initiative Roshan Digital Account (RDA) and strong remittances sent home by overseas Pakistanis.","['The World Bank approved $1.3 billion for Pakistan, including $600 million for Ehsaas programme', 'World Bank and Asian Development Bank (ADB) both have announced to give $10-12 billion each over the next five years', 'Pakistan’s foreign currency reserves further increased by $275 million', 'Reserves may continue to grow with increasing inflows under the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) initiative Roshan Digital Account (RDA) and strong remittances sent home by overseas Pakistanis']",-2
27,"ISLAMABAD:The government on Friday approved Rs1 billion in advertisement budget to highlight its economic performance and contain growing negativity against its policies amid Ministry of FinanceÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s forecast of a further surge in inflation next month.Finance Minister Dr Abdul Hafeez Shaikh chaired a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) to approve the budget two days after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revived PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s bailout package.The IMF has revived its loan programme after Pakistan agreed to impose over Rs700 billion in new taxes from July and collect Rs884 billion from electricity consumers through a 36% increase in power tariffs - the two measures that are highly inflationary.The ECC considered and approved a technical supplementary grant for allocation of funds amounting to Rs1 billion for launching advertisement campaigns by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting to inform and educate people, particularly during the third wave of Covid-19 for the public good, announced the Ministry of Finance on Friday.The ECC summary showed that the money would be given to positively show the governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economic performance, which the information ministry said remained ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœunder-projectedÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â.The summary also claimed that various government programmes were not adequately projected in the media.Success stories of the government, which among many include attracting record remittances, improving foreign currency reserves to record level, keeping the current account balance in positive territory, enhancing exports while containing imports, encouraging Madein-Pakistan products, record growth in large-scale manufacturing, revival of construction sector, improving environmental degradation, reforming tour and travel infrastructure and scores of success stories in many other fields had not been properly advertised in the print and electronic media, said the information ministry.However, many of these successes like increase in exports and decrease in imports were contested by the State Bank of Pakistan.The ECC approved the Rs1 billion additional budget the day the Ministry of Finance hinted at a surge in inflation.In its monthly bulletin, the finance ministry said that next month inflation ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœis expected to remain between 7.9% and 9.5%ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) recorded an increase of 8.7% year-on-year in February - a three-percentage-point increase in a single month due to the governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s policy measures. Inflation is directly hurting every household and no media campaign can lessen prices of electricity, sugar, wheat and wheat flour.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœWhen a government takes shelter in advertisement, it means it has failed to perform on the economic front,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â said Dr Ashfaque Hasan Khan, former adviser to the finance ministry, while speaking at Express News show - The Review.The finance ministry said that recent developments in inflation showed that the declining trend observed in recent months was interrupted in February. Both yearly and monthly inflation increased, it added.The ministry said that international commodity prices were also recently on a rising trend, especially oil prices and food prices, however, the government had not transferred the burden of increase in petrol prices to the general public.Signs of inflationary pressure are building as a key global gauge of companiesÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ input cost inflation rose to its highest for over 12 years in February, feeding through to the largest increase in average selling prices for goods and services for over a decade.It said that global commodity prices continued to surge in February, with energy commodities jumping 14.3% and non-energy commodities rising 2.5%.In this inflationary pressure and slowing economic growth, Pakistan has signed a pact with the IMF that promises to increase electricity prices 36% or Rs5.65 per unit in six months and introduce new taxes of over Rs700 billion from July.The Ministry of Finance also said that the downside risk to cotton production would hamper targeted growth in the agriculture sector. This would not only impact growth but would also push the commodity prices higher.The ministry said the growth of industrial activity was in line with the strong cyclical recovery observed in PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s main trading partners. It is expected that this recovery will continue in the coming months, provided the absence of a new upsurge in Covid-19 that may require restrictions on economic activity.","['Government approved Rs1 billion in advertisement budget to highlight its economic performance', 'Pakistan agreed to impose over Rs700 billion in new taxes from July', '36% increase in power tariffs', 'Increase in electricity prices to Rs5.65 per unit in six months']",-2

But the event went on successfully. On Friday, the three-day 12th Karachi Literature Festival began at the Beach Luxury Hotel but with the emphasis, by those who run it, that this time around itÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s going to be online. Understandably so.The sessions did take place on Friday in which some speakers participated physically and others from across the computer divide. But then, the shocking news of the sudden demise of writer Haseena Moin on Friday morning enveloped the opening ceremony in gloom. It was thoughtful of tings began with Oxford University Press managing director Arshad Saeed HusainÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s welcome speech.

US-China rivalry will come to West Asia, says Vali NasrWith respect to KLF, he told the audience comprising media persons and guest speakers that there was an air of festivity in the previous year when artists and writers engaged in debates. This time around they did consider having the festival open to public, but the third wave of the virus came and they could not take chances with peopleÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s lives.

He spoke online. He said the festivalÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s theme is am world and Pakistan will have to move forward in this new environment and understand the opportunities and challenges that it presents. It is a critical moment because some very important structural shifts have happened in the last three to four years in the world. Some important regional structural shifts put the region and the world in a whole new context.Dr Nasr said after several decades of the unipolar moment in the world where the US was the dominant force and global economics was about integration of all the economies into a single global market, things have changed. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½WeÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½re now seeing a change in that structure, and that change is essentially associated with the rise of China. China itself benefitted from that unipolar period. During that period China was able to grow at an exponential rate below the geopolitical radar to gain the great power status, becoming the worldÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s second largest economy.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½He ampetition is most intense in East Asia, Southeast Asia but ultimately it will come to West Asia.Pandemic and povertyDr Nasr said the second important aspect that heÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½d like to touch upon was the pandemic. He pointed out itÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s a once a generation event. It has had a devastating impact on the world order. It has devastated economic growth in the West and the countries that rely on it. ItÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s going to create a certain degree of poverty across the world. The pandemic has changed things in other ways as well. It has created new kinds of relationships between countries. ItÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s a major challenge to developing countries because of the nature of their economies.Dr Nasr said another important development is the technological change. The past few years have seen opening up of new frontiers that werenÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t there before.

34,"KARACHI:Pakistan has kick-started the process of cutting port charges to bring down the cost of imports and exports and to increase its footprints in facilitating regional and international trade transportation through sea.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe port charges come somewhere between $50,000 to $100,000 per ship depending upon the size of the ship and the number of days it spends to download or upload cargo at a port in the country,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â said Pakistan ShipÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s Agents Association (PSAA) Chairman Mohammed Rajpar while talking to The Express Tribune.He spoke after attending the very first meeting of the committee formed by the cabinet to rationalise port charges.The committee has been tasked to reduce the cost of doing business and increase the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s competitiveness in facilitating regional and international trade transportation through offering better price and quality services.The major port charges include port dues, pilotage in, pilotage out, pilotage charges, ship berthing and storage, it was learnt.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœOur competition (in the region) is with ports of Colombo in Sri Lanka, Salalah in Oman and Jebel Ali in Dubai in transshipment,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â said Rapar, who is also a member of the committee.Local traders alone pay an estimated $5-6 billion in freight charges, including port charges, for import and export in a year, it was learnt.The port charges are targeted to be rationalised to create ease of doing business like the incumbent government has been doing in all sectors to reduce the cost of doing business in Pakistan, he said.To recall, the cost of doing business has gone up in the country following increase in power tariff, passing on the increase in international oil prices to local consumers. Besides, the gas utility firms have once again requested the government to increase gas price as well.The government is bound to increase prices under stringent conditions of the International Monetary FundÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s (IMF) loan programme worth $6 billion.Accordingly, the average inflation reading has remained high at over 8% on an average in the first eight months (Jul-Feb) of current fiscal year against the government target of 6.1% for the year.The average reading may end up somewhere 9% for the full year.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœDuring the meeting, avenues were explored for rationalising port charges in comparison to regional ports. All the stakeholders may have to reduce charges for the realisation of ultimate port charges rationalisation. It would become possible only when the available circumstances are examined in both the ports and shipping sectors equally,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â Karachi Port Trust (KPT) said in a press statement.The meeting was chaired by KPT chairman who is head of the committee. Other committee members were including Port Qasim Authority (PQA) chairman, Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) chairman and Pakistan International Container Terminal (PICT) CEO Khurram Aziz.Rajpar said they would now gather the related data and information to make analysis as to how and from which heads the port charges may be rationalised.He said the committee may meet two to three times over the next 30 days to prepare and second recommendations of the committee to the cabinet.To recall, the international freight charges had gone up by around 500-700% since June 2020, including for traders in Pakistan. Rajpar, however, said this was a temporary phenomenon and freight charges have nothing to do with the port charges. They are two separate things.","['Pakistan has kick-started the process of cutting port charges to bring down the cost of imports and exports', 'The major port charges include port dues, pilotage in, pilotage out, pilotage charges, ship berthing and storage', 'Local traders alone pay an estimated $5-6 billion in freight charges, including port charges, for import and export in a year', 'International freight charges had gone up by around 500-700% since June 2020', 'IMF loan programme worth $6 billion']",-1
35,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader and former prime minister (PM) Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, on Friday, said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had termed the PTI governmentÃ¢Â€Â™s claims as Ã¢Â€ÂœliesÃ¢Â€Â with regards to data on government guarantees in 2016.Talking to reporters, after appearing before Accountability Court-II Muhammad Azam Khan in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) case, he said that no one knew about the agreements made with the IMF.Ã¢Â€ÂœIMF has stated in its report that the government of Pakistan is telling a lie,Ã¢Â€Â he said, while referring to the recent IMF report.When he was asked that according to the IMF the misreported data was related to financial year 2016, which was in the tenure of the PML-N, he said the matter related to the IMFÃ¢Â€Â™s claims regarding inaccurate figures should be investigated.  Ã¢Â€ÂœIf anything was committed wrong in the past, it cannot become a justification for doing wrong today,Ã¢Â€Â he added.He said the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had become an institution of politics and an institution of accountability. Its clear example was todayÃ¢Â€Â™s appearance of the PML-N vice president, Maryam Nawaz, before the NAB. About postponement of MaryamÃ¢Â€Â™s appearance in money laundering and illegal acquisition of land case by the NAB due to the Covid-19, he said that was there no Covid-19 yesterday?  Was there no Covid-19 the day before yesterday, he asked.  Why did the NAB suddenly think about the coronavirus?  He said that those were revengeful activities which flared up people. Ã¢Â€ÂœSupreme Court had said that the NAB was committing political engineering,Ã¢Â€Â he said.He said the justice system and affairs of courts were not encouraging. Ã¢Â€ÂœIf the justice system remains like what we see then how the country will progress,Ã¢Â€Â he asked, adding the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) should tell what it wanted to do with that country.The PML-N leader said the Ã¢Â€ÂœCourts should be respected but when courts fail to provide justice and accountability, institutions become political institutions.Ã¢Â€ÂHe said Ã¢Â€Âœwe were thankful that the countryÃ¢Â€Â™s prime minister presided over a high-level meeting during isolation as he tested positive for the Covid-19,Ã¢Â€Â and discussed the appearance of Maryam in that meeting.Abbasi said Pakistan was one of the only countries in the world that had so far not purchased a single vaccine of coronavirus. He said that according to the Broadsheet Commission the files of Broadsheet were missing from the NAB. About Kashmir, Abbasi said the whole world was talking about an alleged Ã¢Â€ÂœdealÃ¢Â€Â between Pakistan and India, Ã¢Â€Âœbut the parliament has not been informed about it.Ã¢Â€Â Ã¢Â€ÂœHave we backtracked from our principled position on Kashmir?Ã¢Â€Â he asked. He maintained that the alleged Ã¢Â€ÂœdealÃ¢Â€Â on Kashmir was talk of the town.About inflation, he said that sugar prices had risen up to Rs110 per kg. Electricity was most expensive in Pakistan compared to the other countries in the world, he said, adding the price of electricity would be increased up to Rs35 per unit next month. He said the government was burdening the people to meet its expenses.Regarding the long march, he said the long march would be held after a final decision. After he left the court, a NAB witness Amir Haider Malik, in another corruption case, caused panic in the same court, when he told the court recording his statement immediately as he had tested positive for the Covid-19. The disclosure of the witness caused panic in the courtroom. Accountability Court-II Judge Azam Khan, lawyers, and others vacated the courtroom quickly after the removal of the Covid-19 infected witness.The courtroom was then cleaned with a disinfectant, while the Covid-19 infected witness was asked to leave the courtroom immediately. Later, the Accountability Court-II judge cross examined the witness, Abdur Rasheed in the LNG case in the Accountability Court-I room.

40,"EDITORIAL: It's no surprise really that Pakistan's habit of borrowing to survive has got so out of hand that even respected international financial institutions have started sounding the alarm. According to a report titled 'Developing Infrastructure in Central Asia, impacts and financing mechanisms' by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ABDI), Pakistan's external debt has now reached a level where any further borrowing seriously risks destabilising the whole economy. That, of course, is because requirements of debt servicing and interest payments prevent the country from using its resources for development of its infrastructure. And that brings us to the main problem about the debt that is clearly no longer sustainable. For we haven't just borrowed, and must now pay back, well above a hundred billion dollars just from external sources, but it's not very easy to see where all that money has gone.Surely none, or not very much, of it has gone into building any sort of infrastructure at all. With an energy crisis, a water crisis, and an economy in free-fall, Pakistan has the lowest development ranking in the region and stands at 110 out of 137 countries in terms of infrastructure. Over the years, this has led to declining business competitiveness, lower GDP growth and reduced tax revenue. The problem is now made much worse because debt repayment, along with things like defence spending and general administration, take up a lion's share of the budget and whatever money is urgently needed elsewhere is routinely cut from development spending. To make up for all this the government is forced to increase taxes on business and the general public, because there are always just too many feudal lords and industrial barons in parliament to allow any taxes to rise on the rich; and so we go round in circles.A depreciated rupee, whose fall was so widely celebrated as liberation of sorts from Ishaq Dar's tight control at about a hundred to the dollar, has also inflated interest payment in real terms. This is the kind of cocktail that spurs investors, both foreign and domestic one. They, therefore, do not hesitate to make a beeline for the exit lounge, delivering the economy a likely kiss of death because with the government's spending ability severely compromised, private money is very desperately needed to snap out of this vicious circle that has the country seeking fresh loans not just to stay above water and avoiding default on servicing and repayment of old loans all the time.This is indeed a very difficult situation to handle because it's not just a fiscal nightmare but also a national embarrassment that even the prime minister's kitchen runs on borrowed money, and therefore borrowed time. That brings us back to the question of just what these billions upon billions of dollars have been used for. Sadly, everybody knows that while the country was left locked in a cycle of borrow-to-survive and borrow-to-repay, a lot of people that signed on the dotted line also grew very rich in the years that the debt balloon was inflated. So, to cut a very long and unfortunate story short, the debt piled on, the country grew poorer, a few political families became very rich, and the rest of the people must now pay for it, figuratively as well as literally, for a number of generations. Sooner or later, the government will be forced to give infrastructure the kind of fiscal attention that it needs even after all the blessings that have come with the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). But, again, before that it would have to find ways to create some additional fiscal space. Yet there's no easy way to expand its list of available options. And just when the good news about the G20 debt moratorium came after the bad news of the pandemic and the lockdowns, some disturbing news also came about some of the world's top ratings agencies downgrading the sovereign ratings of some of the countries that availed the facility. That is very bad news for Pakistan, of course, since we are also in line for it. No doubt the government understands very well that the only thing standing between long-term survival and possible sovereign default somewhere down the road is precisely the ability to build enough infrastructure to fuel growth and improve revenue in time. Such things take much time, though, so the sooner the official machinery springs into action the better.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021",['Pakistan has the lowest development ranking in the region and stands at 110 out of 137 countries in terms of infrastructure'],5
41,"LAHORE: A Pak-born American, close aide of US President Joe Biden and leader of the Democratic party, Tahir Javed, has said that there should be no hurry on withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan as it would lead to another chaotic situation. He said Biden was working on attaining perpetual peace in Afghanistan through continuation of peace talks with the Taliban.He was addressing ""Meet the Press"" at Lahore Press Club on Saturday. It may be noted that President of Pakistan Dr Arif Alvi has also awarded him Pride of Performance on March 23, at Aiwan-e-Sadr.According to him, he has been in the US politics for a long period and contributing to the well-being of Pakistanis through the platform of Democrats. According to him, he has been assisting his party on the financial side, however, no new assignment has so far been given to him.He said 150 congressmen had condemned through resolutions the annexation of Kashmir by India. The majority of congressional leaders from Democrats have been advocating for the Kashmiris on account of the violation of human rights. Unfortunately, he said the internal situation including Corona has consumed much time of President Biden. After getting free from the internal issues, President Biden would take up the issue of Kashmir, he asserted.He said President Biden was in favour of balanced relations in terms of trade and people to people interaction. Biden is a man of words and would follow his commitment towards Pakistan.He added that he is working on enhancing trade between the two sides besides improving the status of Pakistanis in the US. He asserted that Pakistan's inclination towards China is unconditional. The CPEC is not an issue but still Pakistanis should keep in mind that 25% of the world's consumption is in the US. Prime Minister Imran Khan also understands it and there is a need to increase bilateral relations between Pakistan and the US, he added.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021","[""Pakistan's inclination towards China and CPEC""]",-2

43,"KARACHI: The Chairman of the National Business Group and President of Pakistan Businessmen and Intellectuals Forum, Mian Zahid Hussain, has welcomed Pakistan's re-entry into the $6-billion IMF programme. The development would improve confidence of the developed world and international institutions, but it would be at a cost, he said.Mian Zahid Hussain said that the process of reforms was underway for decades, but the focus was not national development but to please the lenders. He said that the IMF directives had damaged the economy before the pandemic, and it was feared that with the new development the people would have to face a new round of inflation, unemployment and business closures.He said that the economy and the people could not withstand the harsh IMF conditions which included cutting of developmental spending, reducing subsidies, increasing taxes and hiking power and gas tariffs. The so-called reforms would push many businesses into losses while withdrawal of corporate tax exemptions to the tune of Rs140 billion would hit confidence and new investments, he observed. He said that the IMF had never pushed Pakistan to reduce inefficiency and corruption but it had always targeted the poor.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021","['Increasing taxes and hiking power and gas tariffs', 'Withdrawal of corporate tax exemptions to the tune of Rs140 billion']",-2
44,"The National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) on Sunday decided to ban wedding ceremonies from April 5 onwards in cities and districts where the positivity rate is above 8 per cent, as part of new restrictions to contain the third wave of the novel coronavirus in Pakistan. Federal Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar chaired the session which was attended by the chief secretaries of all four provinces via video link. In the meeting, the NCOC decided the ban would extend to both indoor and outdoor weddings, however, ""provinces will be at liberty to implement restrictions in [an] early time frame as per the situation on ground"". Meanwhile, in a televised message, Prime Minister Imran Khan strongly urged the public to follow Covid-19 SOPs and the necessary precautions, cautioning that the third wave of the virus in Pakistan was ""more intense"" than the first two waves.The new set of restrictions comes as Pakistan finds itself in the grips of a third coronavirus wave. Pakistan recorded more than 4,000 cases for a third straight day on Sunday with 4,767 new coronavirus cases and 57 deaths in the last 24 hours. This marks the highest single-day increase since June 21, 2020, according to data collected by Dawn.com, when 4,916 cases were reported.   The current spike was again led by Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Islamabad with 2,823, 979 and 538 new cases, respectively.The country-wide breakdown of new cases is as follows:Punjab: 2,823Khyber Pakhtunkhwa: 979Islamabad: 538Sindh: 252Azad Jammu and Kashmir: 122Balochistan: 44Gilgit Baltistan: 9Umar said the decision to tighten restrictions was taken keeping in mind the ""continuing increase in disease spread and the fast pace at which hospital fill up is taking place"", particularly pointing to the increase in cases of critical Covid patients. He said the provincial chief secretaries had been instructed to ensure compliance of Covid-19 standard operating procedures (SOPs) and urged people to ""cooperate with the administration as they are enforcing these SOPs for safeguarding us"".   Along with weddings, all kinds of indoor and outdoor gatherings were also banned with immediate effect. This order includes all social, cultural, political, sports gatherings and other events.Options were also considered to restrict inter-provincial transport but the final decision on this will be taken after ""input from provinces and analysis of data regarding number of inter-provincial commuters via air, rail and road"".Additionally, provinces were urged to ensure timely completion of inoculation targets set by the NCOC and timely uploading and registering of data in the National Immunisation Management System Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ an online portal that serves as the Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½brainÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ of the vaccination process.The NCOC will""enforcement of expanded lockdowns with effect from March 29 (Monday)"".

Imran reiterated that the country could not afford to close down businesses and the economy or lock down people and continue to feed them, citing a lack of resources.But the public could help avoid a catastrophic scenario by wearing masks and avoiding public gatherings or enclosed spaces, the premier stressed.""Half of our hospitals are filled, patients are increasing in the hospitals [and] are going on ventilators and oxygen,"" he said, noting that the infection rise seen in the third wave was due to the British variant of the virus which had caused cases to increase in Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar. Prime Minister Imran also pointed out that the world was facing a vaccine shortage and Pakistan was now being told it wouldn't be able to get the vaccines it had earlier been assured of due to shortages in vaccine producing countries. ""God had mercy on me and my wife, but because I've passed through this, let me tell you that this is such a disease that if it spreads to your chest then it is a very dangerous disease. That is why I'm urging you to take full precautions regarding it.""Umar had warned yesterday after a session of the NCOC that Pakistan's coronavirus situation could soon cross levels seen during the first wave in June last year. ""If the increase continues at this rate, then in the next few days or next week, we will go beyond the level and peak we saw in the first wave in June and you all must remember what the situation was at the time,"" he had said.

Governor Sindh, Imran Ismail was the chief guest of the event who participated in the convocation with his message to the students.On this memorable occasion around more than 1100 degrees were awarded to the pass-outs of BS and MS programme. Position holders were awarded with gold, silver and bronze medals for securing highest marks in the respective disciplines. Rehan Shams and Ali Akber Siddiqui received degrees of Doctor of Philosophy in Electronic Engineering.Addressing the graduates at 24th SSUET Convocation Governor Sindh, Imran Ismail said that the 40 percent of the students leave their homeland for better opportunities after graduation. However, today Pakistan also has many opportunities and graduates don't need to go abroad for better prospects. Prime Minister's Kamyab Nojawan programme not only provides them jobs but also give them chance to be the jobs providers. Only those achieve high targets who have big dreams and think high.Speaking on the occasion, Chancellor of Sir Syed University of Engineering & Technology, Jawaid Anwar said that the Convocation is culmination of your tireless efforts with feeling of accomplishment in life. It is a glorious occasion to cherish. It is a moment to rejoice an important landmark that gives recognition to the efforts, support and sacrifices of your parents, guardians, whether in the form of devotion of time and energy for your studies or financing studies or accumulation of responsibilities in your journey in pursuit of education.Chancellor Jawaid Anwar pointed out that although the whole social and cultural structure has changed into a new mode of routine life due to Covid-19, yet Sir Syed University successfully endeavoured not to let the situation affect the academic activities, maintaining quality performance in the crucial period of corona.He said the concept of social reforms of Sir Syed Ahmed Khan was based upon acquisition of modern scientific education. The key ingredients of this concept were proper upbringing, character building, tolerance and coexistence. Aligarh Muslim University proved to be the laboratory where these concepts were experimented, which produced students who possessed the above traits.Regarding construction of SSUET New Campus, Chancellor Jawaid Anwar said that the construction of the new campus of Sir Syed University will commence with the construction of the mosque at 200 acres Land of Sir Syed University at Education City.Appreciating the efforts made by the graduates for achieving the honour, Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Vali Uddin said that the innovation and emerging technologies together can open up new vistas of development and prosperity for Pakistan. Sir Syed University has always endeavoured to be progressive, responsive to advancement in science, engineering and technology or business management. These days there is more focus on innovation and research. It is now necessary to figure out the new demands according to the global changes, and to update the students with new academic environment.He pointed out that Sir Syed University has been selected by HEC to be part of the World Bank funded Higher Education Data Repository - Piloting Phase Project for its exclusive performance of Online Readiness Report and timely submission of Higher Education Statistical (HES) Data.Presenting progress report of Sir Syed University, Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Vali Uddin said that Sir Syed University as an important partner with Ministry of Information and IdeaGist established National Ideas Bank, inaugurated by the President Arif Alvi, to encourage all Pakistanis to innovate and develop new ideas that can solve problems faced by the citizens.

46,"ISLAMABAD:Civil society activists, particularly those working in the field of environment protection, on Saturday expressed surprise at PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s exclusion from a virtual summit on climate change next month called by US President Joe Biden.Biden ignored Pakistan at his governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s first summit on climate change to be held on April 22 and 23. The US president has invited 40 heads of state and government, who also include leaders of India, Bangladesh and Bhutan ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ from the South Asian region. According to a White House announcement on Friday, the virtual summit would be addressed by leaders of Russia, China, Argentina, Australia, France, Indonesia, Germany, Israel, Canada, Japan, Italy, Kenya, Mexico, Denmark, Colombia, Congo, Chile, Jamaica and other countries.Several Pakistanis took to various social media platforms to express surprise at the exclusion of Pakistan, particularly when the country is among the nations most affected by climate change. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, Pakistan is the fifthmost vulnerable country. Experts also pointed out that climate change is a key area of focus of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, as they mentioned that Prime Minister Imran Khan has initiated the Billion-Tree Tsunami project for the environment protection, besides several other measures.Senior journalist Kamran Yousaf noted that the decision was not surprising if a recent statement of a former US diplomat is to be considered.

ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœIt appears the main criteria for being invited are (1) close partner of the US or (2) a major polluter or (3) highly vulnerable to climate change or (4) some combo of 1,2,3. Pakistan certainly qualifies for (3),ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â he wrote on his twitter account.Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Malik Amin Aslam said that the countries invited to the summit fell in two categories and added that Pakistan did not belong to any of those. He did not explain the two categories. He said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had been tasked to clarify the summit. Responding to query, the Foreign Office spokesperson stated that the summit hosted by President Biden reconvenes the US-led Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate, which brings together leaders from countries responsible for approximately 80% of global emissions and GDP. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœPakistan, despite being among the top ten countries affected by climate change, is one of the lowest emitters ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ with less than one per cent of the global emissions,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â the Foreign Office spokesperson said.He added that the US summit includes representation from countries holding chairs of geographic regions and groups including leastdeveloped countries, small island developing states, and the climate vulnerable forum. Pakistan, the spokesperson emphasised, was also contributing meaningfully towards shaping a global climate change discourse, as the vice president of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and member of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.He reminded that Pakistan cochaired the multibillion-dollar Green Climate Fund, established to support climate actions in developing countries, last year. PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s commitment to addressing climate change and the prime ministerÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s leadership on this account ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœis well accepted and appreciated around the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â, he added. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s landmark initiatives like the Billion Tree Tsunami have won international acclaim, including from the World Economic Forum,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â the spokesperson said, referring to a documentary by the WEF earlier this month, highlighting Pakistan governmentÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s environment-related initiatives. ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœClimate change is one of the defining challenges of our times that can only be countered through inclusive, cooperative and forward-looking policies.Pakistan remains fully committed to play its due role in this fight,ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â the spokesperson added. The summit is taking place at a time when the United States has re-joined the Paris Agreement after the departure of former president Donald Trump and ahead of a UN conference on the issue in Glasgow in November this year. The White House said in a statement that the ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœvirtual meetingÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â will focus on how to create better jobs by preventing climate change, adding that in this regard high technology would be developed and weak countries would be helped.ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚ÂœThe Leaders Summit on Climate will underscore the urgency ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ and the economic benefits ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ of stronger climate action.

48,"EDITORIAL: Tensions between Pakistan and India seem to be easing somewhat. In a surprise development last month, the two countries directors general of military operations (DGMOs) held a meeting in a ""cordial atmosphere"" and announced an agreement ""for strict observance of all agreements, understandings and cease firing along the LoC and all other sectors, with effect from midnight 24/25 February"". The statement also contained signs of a thaw in bilateral relations as it said ""in the interest of achieving mutually beneficial and sustainable peace, the two DGMOs agreed to address each other's core issues/concerns which have the propensity to disturb peace and lead to violence"". Although some on this side insisted the statement should to be read within the context of ceasefire violations, New Delhi expressed its desire to have ""normal neighbourly relations"" with Pakistan. Press reports emanating from India now say Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi is likely to meet his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on the sidelines of the upcoming ""Heart of Asia"" conference in Tajikistan's capital Dushanbe. According to these reports, the two sides are to discuss the Saarc summit - which has remained in abeyance since 2016 due to Pak-India tensions - to be held in Islamabad; and that there is a strong chance of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's participation in it. They are also to discuss reinstatement, at the earliest, of high commissioners in both the countries. Given the hostility that has characterized Modi government's policy towards this country, there surely is more to these developments than meets the eye. At least three good reasons suggest the Biden administration may have (through intermediaries reportedly the UAE) nudged PM Modi to improve relations with Pakistan. One, of course, is that the US needs Pakistan's help to end its longest war in Afghanistan. Secondly, while the US strategists see India as a counterweight to China, they do not want the country to be dragged down by its ceaseless conflict with Pakistan. On its part, India is happy to get a seat at the high table as a partner in the US' Indo-Pacific strategy. Third, President Joe Biden may be finding it difficult to ignore the humanitarian crisis in the Illegally Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, given that during his election campaign he had expressed concern over human rights violations. Also, in a policy paper titled ""Joe Biden's agenda for Muslim American community"" he had decried the Citizens Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens as being inconsistent with the country's long-standing tradition of secularism and with sustaining a multi-ethnic and multi-religious democracy.Jammu and Kashmir being the core issue of Pak-India conflict, Islamabad had decided to downgrade diplomatic ties on August 7, 2019, two days after New Delhi scrapped article 370 of its constitution that gave special status to the disputed region. In a usual tit-for-tat reaction, India had recalled its envoy to this country.  Resumption of a meaningful dialogue process, therefore, is contingent upon resolution of the situation in occupied Kashmir. For a start, India must end the military siege; stop human rights violations and abuses; free all illegally detained Kashmiris, and repeal the new domicile and property laws aimed at changing the disputed region's demographic complexion. Its ultra-Hindu nationalist prime minister is not expected to easily agree to any proposal for dismantling the anti-Muslim and anti-Pakistan hostility structure he has built his entire political career on. Still, that country's influential friends, in particular the US, can play a role in promoting a substantive peace dialogue between the two nuclear-armed nations. They need to do that for the sake of peace and stability of this region, which is in their own interest.Copyright Business Recorder, 2021",['Tensions between Pakistan and India seem to be easing'],0

50,"Without reforms and better efficiency, tariff hike may be counter-productive
ISLAMABAD:
 
 The government has announced plans to increase  power tariff  by Rs5.65 per unit, an estimated 40% increase. Gas utilities have asked for similar or even higher increase in their tariffs. 
 In this space, we will examine the non-tariff options to deal with problems of rising cost and circular debt, which has forced the government to propose the increase in power tariff. Over-capacity and high cost agreements will have a long shadow over the current and future tariff issues. However, reforms are overdue. Without undertaking reforms and increasing efficiency, the tariff hike alone may prove to be counter-productive. 
 It would be a political and economic risk to try to eke out all circular debt from  consumers . As a rule, any capacity payments under capacity utilisation of 60-66% cannot be passed on to consumers, until the economy starts growing at a pace of 7% or so. 
 To the extent of under-utilisation of capacity, ways and means would have to be found to finance part of its adjustment through refinancing, debt rescheduling and passing some burden to provinces. Some improvements in capacity utilisation should be possible by removing transmission and distribution (T&D) constraints as well. 
 Reduce power tariff, electricity demand will  increase . This is the most controversial yet a subject with great potential. This is reverse of the increase in power tariff. 
 If this is not true for the residential consumers, it should be true for the commercial and industrial sectors. By increasing demand and thus increasing capacity utilisation, the unit cost will decrease with its impact on circular debt. 
 Had serious work been done on this aspect, perhaps, the IMF would have been less relentless in pursuing its demand for a large tariff increase. The recent IPP agreement is a welcome step. These concessions are, however, for the longer term benefit and do not help bridge the current revenue shortfall. 
 Finally, Nepra should fast track institutionalising these adjustments into a permanent framework. Main issues are revised rates of return on equity (ROE) at 12%, interest rates and risk margins. 
 It is highly inequitable that G2G projects, which normally enjoy sovereign guarantees, have the same return and debt terms as given to the normal commercial contracts, which face higher risks. Softer lending rates should be required for G2G projects in which normally capital expenditure (capex) is higher due to the lack of competition. We are suffering from a capacity glut. The least that can be done is to advance the schedule of new projects. 
 Distribution firms 
 Putting the distribution companies (DISCOs) right should be on top of the agenda along with doing away with the inefficient generation companies (Gencos). On the DISCOs and T&D side, major improvements and reforms are required, which is almost half of the problem. 
 T&D losses are high and almost stagnant at 18.3%. There is an issue of receivables of around Rs1 trillion as well, although, allegedly, receivables are exaggerated to reduce losses and enhance the balance sheet appearance. 
 Many reforms have been discussed and are overdue like reducing the geographical size of loss-making companies like Pesco and Mepco. Privatisation, either as leasing, management transfer or outright sale has been discussed for a long time. Time has arrived to implement any viable scheme. 
 Unfortunately, the revival of Pakistan Electric Power Company (Pepco) has been put off. Pepco could have provided the much-needed intermediary layer for a technical and management role, which is currently occupied by the ministerial bureaucracy. 
 Much hope is being tied to the new independent boards, which are neither independent nor effective. 
 Two hours of meetings of a motley crowd of experts and vested interests cannot possibly replace an effective supervisory role that can be offered by Pepco or give it a new and better name with enhanced role to include Gencos and a strong technical component. 
 There are some technical issues as well, which require immediate attention for improving DISCOsÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™ performance and reducing theft. 
 Smart distribution transformers (DT), with smart meters installed on DTs, have been discussed, offering tremendous efficiency improvement opportunities at a smaller cost than installing smart meters at consumer prices, as proposed by the Asian Development Bank. 
 They will provide an electricity accounting framework on geographically locating theft and losses to manageably smaller areas covered by DTs. K-Electric has done it and is reaping its benefits. USAID has already provided a nucleus through its pilot projects at Mepco and Pesco, which being high-loss companies should have been selected in the first place instead of Lesco and Iesco. 
 With the installation of two capital-intensive nuclear power plants of 1,100 megawatts each, there should be some action on shutting down the inefficient Gencos. 
 Ultimately, the open market and competition will open the doors for cheaper gas and electricity, it is argued by many. However, it is a long-term and time-taking issue. 
 Competition 
 Nepra is working on the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM), which has many inadequacies and issues. With or without CTBCM, there should be no constraints on introducing wires-only model in DISCOs. This will simplify complications of privatisation. 
 Some competition can be introduced, without waiting for CTBCM and its implementation, under solicited bidding and by doing away with unsolicited projects, which are partly a source of many vices. 
 There has always been a fear in going for competition. Had this not been the case, our plight could have been better. 
 Similarly, all talk of replacing ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœtake and payÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â instead of the current ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Âœtake or payÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â is simplistic. Take and pay works in competitive markets where the price is determined by competition. Decreasing capacity utilisation from 80% to 60-66% under the take-and-pay model has no practical cost reduction impact. 
 Reforms are due in the Integrated Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP). The plan has been made under three assumptions of economic growth of 4-7%. Current growth rate is 3% and is likely to remain low due to the Covid debt and other issues. 
 Despite these changes, project approval continues to be uninfluenced. Its time horizon should be reduced to 10 years and yearly adjustments should be made in a 10-year rolling plan. Poor should be our focus and priority in drawing any financial scheme. There is a case for introducing direct transfer of power and gas subsidies to the poor consumers. This can be introduced under the Ehsaas programme and financed under the general budget and debt. 
 It may have acceptability from the IFIs and may help in reducing the proposed increase. There are other proposals of linking tariff subsidies to localities and plot sizes rather than consumption alone. It may add complexity but may release some resources for passing them to the poor.

52,"Farmers cannot switch to new technologies as they require heavy investment
KARACHI:
 
 Agriculture is one of the key sectors of  Pakistan ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s economy. It comprises crops, livestock, forestry and fishing with crops being the major component. 
 This sector not only produces 19.3% of total output of the country but also provides employment to around 38.7% of the population, higher than all other sectors. This sector supports other related industries such as textile, sugar, tractor manufacturing, fertiliser, etc through strong forward and backward linkages. 
 A high yield in the  agriculture sector  also fosters commerce and trade since most of the farmers fall in the low or lower middle-income group whose marginal propensity to consume is high. Therefore, the contribution of this sector goes beyond what is reflected by statistics. Unfortunately, the sector, like many others, is performing well below its potential. Among major crops, the production of cotton is declining continuously over the last few years. 
 Last year, Pakistan produced around 9.18 million bales of cotton whereas in 2014-15, its production was 13.96 million bales. 
 Last year, the output of wheat and sugarcane was also insufficient to meet the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s needs. Owing to this, the government had to import both sugar and wheat, which placed an additional burden on the national exchequer. 
 If we look at productivity, PakistanÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s per acre yield of  major crops  is less than that of other countries in the region. Unfortunately, this gap is widening further. There is an urgent need to study the factors and put in all efforts to revive the sector. 
 There is a long list of problems that need to be addressed. However, this piece will cover only some of those and the rest will be discussed sometime later. 
 Research centres 
 First, there is a need to restructure the agricultural research institutes. In line with the best global practices, the pay and incentive structure must be revised and linked with the output on the ground. 
 If we link the research institutes with industries and develop a revenue-sharing mechanism, such that part of revenue from a newly developed or improved product goes to the institution and the researcher also gets a fixed percentage, then this will not only incentivise the development of quality seeds, better pesticides and good farm techniques, but will also help increase the budget of such institutes. 
 Departments of agriculture at provincial levels are not playing their role actively. In fact, their performance has deteriorated over time. In the past, the Punjab agriculture department used to lease small pieces of land in various villages to cultivate crops with the help of local farmers by applying new techniques and latest research. 
 Field officers and other staff of the department used to visit and examine the land with the farmers and briefed them about their experiences. Such arrangements acted as field schools for the farmers, who could learn and update their farming skills by listening to the experts and observing the outcome of newly applied techniques. 
 However, now for more than a decade, not such activity has been noted anywhere. Instead, the agriculture department arranges seminars in expensive hotels in cities, thus limiting the access of small farmers to such sessions. 
 Apart from that, these seminars are arranged with the support of pesticide, fertiliser or seed companies. This gives birth to serious conflict of interest and the recommendations given through such platforms are not trusted. 
 The absence of guidelines from independent sources has left farmers at the mercy of sales agents of the pesticide, fertiliser and seed firms. Students of economics know that firms aim to maximise profit by selling maximum quantity and at the highest possible price, but this leads to an increase in the cost of agriculture production. 
 Therefore, there is a need to think of the role of agriculture departments in the provinces. 
 Water scarcity 
 Water shortage is another issue that is affecting agricultural output. Pakistan has not built any major dam for decades, therefore, the scarcity of water is affecting every sector and its consequences can be more severe in future. 
 Experts call for adopting modern irrigation systems such as drip irrigation and sprinkle irrigation, as embraced by various countries. The government, with the help of global financial institutions, is working to facilitate the adoption of such technologies, but all suggestions and actions ignore the fact that in Pakistan a majority of the farmers hold small-sized farms (of less than 12.5 acres). 
 These farmers cannot afford to switch to these technologies as they require heavy investment, even after subsidies are provided. Unfortunately, these farmers also have limited access to financial support from banks for various reasons. 
 Therefore, there is a need to provide solutions that can remove the constraints. Unfortunately, not a single solution has been proposed by any publicly funded research institute or department. 
 Fortunately, Pedavar, an NGO led by a renowned agricultural expert and run by farmers themselves, has come up with a cheap solution. They favour the cultivation of crops on raised beds and keeping the beds covered with residual of the previous crop. This slows down the evaporation process and keeps the beds wet for a long period, thus the farmers do not need to water the fields for a longer period. 
 As per Pedavar, it not only results in 70% reduction in water consumption, but the residual also keeps the fertility of soil high, thus fertiliser is not needed, which further slashes the cost. 
 Food crops cultivated as per the proposed system can be sold as organic food in the global market. This way, exports and foreign exchange earnings can be multiplied. 
 Agriculture departments and research centres can test the system. If it works, then they must educate the farmers at grassroots level. Setting up field schools for the purpose, as Punjab did in the past, will accelerate its adoption. 
 It needs to be pointed out that most of the graduates in the field of agriculture end up joining the sales teams of pesticide, fertiliser and seed companies. This is apparently the field of marketing graduates and a graduate in agriculture should ideally take farming as the profession as the knowledge he/she has gained will be utilised better. 
 The government can introduce an incentive programme which encourages the agricultural graduates to join farming as the profession. Incentives can include leasing public land to the graduates at concessionary rates, priority access to loans, etc.

To cater to the needs of a sector that by definition is unrecorded canÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½t be straight forward. It will require rigorous planning and execution. Job creation in an underperforming economy is not just a social issue. It is a matter of cropping the opportunity cost of idle resources in men and material. After all, services offered by the informal sector have a market and are critical to citizensÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ needs (house help, plumbers, electricians, groomers, tailors, tutors, caterers, runners, car cleaners and technicians, veggie and fruit vendors, etc).Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½If the government can provide an amnesty to builders and developers in the construction sector to achieve a greater goal of wealth creation, i commented an economist while discussing the collapse of the parallel economy in the wake of the pandemic.Dr Hafiz A Pasha, former finance minister and a leading economist, shared strong views on the subject that he said pained him. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½It is sad to watch this level of suffering. The income of working families is falling and the cost of living is rising, making life miserable for so many.

Why did it not support the collapsing small businesses when it went out of the way to help the corporate sector? There is no defence for neglecting a sector that engages more than half of the workforce.Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½He made a case for extending a Rs500-600 billion micro-credit line to fix the broken financial cycle of small businesses through credible institutions such as Kashf Foundation.Dr Nadeem Javed, former chief economist of the Planning Commission, concurred with Dr Pasha.

54,"Notwithstanding some fleeting moments of political triumphs and economic gains for the policymakers, the lack of strategic breakthrough over the past two years plus the political heat generated by multiple crises are together turning out to be a game-changer. And pieced together, the historical baggage inherited by the government is providing backup support for a radical change in national security policy. The situation, as it is developing, is prompting the government to redesign national security policy with economic progress as its core. It is broadly defined to include human security. Addressing Islamabad Security Dialogue on March 17, the advisor on commerce and investment Razak Dawood stressed that a strong economy will enhance the countryÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s power and strengthen national security. Mr Dawood recalled that history has shown that economic backwardness led to social conflicts and political turmoil and this weakened national security. The New Comprehensive Security Framework evolved and incumbent government is based on three pillars of military, economic and human security. The framework has redefined the frontiers of security to include climate security, food security and economic prosperity.Development experts recognise that the uneven growth of various sectors of the economy is a major cause of surging inequality in regional development and household incomesSimilarly, consultations for policymaking will be much more broad-based with an intake of diverse views and inputs.The recently set up National Security Division connects over 100 think-tanks and university departments with policymakers. These entities can send their recommendations directly to the Security Division. Mr Dawood reminded his audience that the loss of economic security led to the erosion of national sovereignty. It may be recalled that the decade of development of the 1960s created a strong public perception about gross disparity in regional development and household incomes and led to political turmoil, armed conflict, Indian intervention and the great tragedy of 1971. National sovereignty can only be strengthened by a policy of self-reliance with a strong focus on citizenÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s welfare.The industrial revolution ushered in the country by former President Mohammad Ayub Khan needed a corresponding updated political system to unite a deeply divided nation.The national unity was regained when the assembly members elected in free and fair 1970 elections unanimously adopted the 1973 Constitution. The citizen-based democracy is essential to rebuild a common interest state as opposed to divisive dysfunctional hybrid democracy. Mr Dawood also made another very pertinent point. He said a nation like Pakistan could not depend on import and trading and the country needed to focus on manufacturing based on technology. And he added that a strong industrial base has to be anchored to agriculture, energy, food and financial security. Development experts recognise that the uneven growth of various sectors of the ecf surging inequality in regional development and household incomes. Mr Dawood views are somewhat similar to President Biden foreign trade policy inherited from Donald Trump. Katherine Tai of the United States Trade Representative Office recently told the US Senate that she would protect the rights and interests of the American workers rather than exporters or consumers. That means supporting the domestic manufacturing sector. In his first major foreign policy speech on March 3, Secretary of State Antony J Blinken said the calculus on free trade has changed. The Biden Administration has put new trade deals on the back burner while focusing on the domestic economy. Globalisation is now in a transformational phase with enormous international flows of updated information and knowledge, embedded in new technologies, scientific discoveries and innovative ideas to bring about the needed change. International cooperation is now focused on health care as a result of the common threat from coronavirus. Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½cs to redefine itself and progress towards the modernised economy from where it not seen from the microscope because of what is happening in Afghanistan,Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½ said former US Ambassador to Pakistan Cameron Munter at the Islamabad Security Dialogue forum. He was giving his views on the future of US-Pakistan relations. Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa says we need to Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½put our house in orderÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½. There can be no two opinions about it. We need to develop a sound and effective long-term strategy to put the political economy on an even keel and lower the political temperature to create a conducive environment for the government and business to work in harmony to rebuild Pakistan. And as it appears, from now on to the end of his tenure, Prime Minister Imran Khan is likely to spend much of his time fighting a battle for survival like all his predecessors did. The crises-triggered political pressure is unlikely to ease as it is further fproach to dealing with political rivals. The new comprehensive security framework is a step in the right direction. But this requires a correction course where a number of official policies and decisions are working at cross purposes. How can the International Monetary FundÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s (IMF) tax-and energy-reforms that are proposed to be enforced through ordinances succeed without national consensus and ownership? This demonstrates that there is strong opposition within the government as well as from common citizens against IMF policies. There is a need to review the role of elected representatives and technocrats in policymaking. In a democracy, technocrats are needed to provide policy inputs and not formulate policies unacceptable to elected representatives and the parliament. It is encouraging that there is a general consensus in the top civil and military leadership that PakistanÃ¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½Ã¯Â¿Â½s best defence is as much the prosperity of its people as the integrity of its borderenant General Talat Masood. He emphasises that this demands a sustained, integrated and comprehensive approach towards security spanning decades.The quality of life of the common citizens can best be improved by allowing the people to exercise their sovereign right to rule through representatives elected in a free and fair election. Under representative democracy, the elected members of the National Assembly and Member of the provincial assemblies are duty-bound to implement the policies and programmes approved by the electorate. And they are accountable to voters/active citizenry and no one else. Otherwise, we are left with a lame-duck democracy and aggravating political and economic problems that erode national security.
